Remember
Our inheritance hath been turned to strangers
Orphans we have been -- without a father
Our water for money we have drunk
For our neck we have been pursued
`To' Egypt we have given a hand
Our fathers have sinned -- they are not
Servants have ruled over us
With our lives we bring in our bread
Our skin as an oven hath been burning
Wives in Zion they have humbled
Princes by their hand have been hanged
Young men to grind they have taken
The aged from the gate have ceased
Ceased hath the joy of our heart
Fallen hath the crown `from' our head
For this hath our heart been sick
For the mount of Zion -- that is desolate
Thou
Why for ever dost Thou forget us? Thou forsakest us for length of days!"
Turn us back
For hast Thou utterly rejected us? Thou hast been wroth against us -- exceedingly?"
