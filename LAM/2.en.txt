How doth the Lord cloud in His anger the daughter of Zion
Swallowed up hath the Lord
He hath cut off in the heat of anger every horn of Israel
He hath trodden His bow as an enemy
The Lord hath been as an enemy
And He shaketh as a garden His tabernacle
The Lord hath cast off His altar
Devised hath Jehovah to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion
Sunk into the earth have her gates
Sit on the earth -- keep silent do the elders of the daughter of Zion
Consumed by tears have been my eyes
To their mothers they say
What do I testify `to' thee
Thy prophets have seen for thee a false and insipid thing
Clapped hands at thee have all passing by the way
Opened against thee their mouth have all thine enemies
Jehovah hath done that which He devised
Cried hath their heart unto the Lord; O wall of the daughter of Zion
Arise
See
Lain on the earth `in' out-places have young and old
Thou dost call as `at' a day of appointment
