How is the gold become dim
The precious sons of Zion
Even dragons have drawn out the breast
Cleaved hath the tongue of a suckling unto his palate with thirst
Those eating of dainties have been desolate in out-places
And greater is the iniquity of the daughter of my people
Purer were her Nazarites than snow
Darker than blackness hath been their visage
Better have been the pierced of a sword Than the pierced of famine
The hands of merciful women have boiled their own children
Completed hath Jehovah His fury
Believe not did the kings of earth
Because of the sins of her prophets
They have wandered naked in out-places
`Turn aside -- unclean
The face of Jehovah hath divided them
While we exist -- consumed are our eyes for our vain help
They have hunted our steps from going in our broad-places
Swifter have been our pursuers
The breath of our nostrils -- the anointed of Jehovah
Joy and rejoice
Completed `is' thy iniquity
