How hath she sat alone
She weepeth sore in the night
Removed hath Judah because of affliction
The ways of Zion are mourning
Her adversaries have become chief
And go out from the daughter of Zion doth all her honour
Remembered hath Jerusalem `In' the days of her affliction and her mournings
A sin hath Jerusalem sinned
Her uncleanness `is' in her skirts
His hand spread out hath an adversary On all her desirable things
All her people are sighing -- seeking bread
`Is it' nothing to you
From above He hath sent fire into my bone
Bound hath been the yoke of my transgressions by His hand
Trodden down all my mighty ones hath the Lord in my midst
For these I am weeping
Spread forth hath Zion her hands
Righteous is Jehovah
I called for my lovers
See
They have heard that I have sighed
Come in doth all their evil before Thee
