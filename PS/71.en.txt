In Thee
In Thy righteousness Thou dost deliver me
Be to me for a rock -- a habitation
O my God
For Thou `art' my hope
By Thee I have been supported from the womb
As a wonder I have been to many
Filled is my mouth `with' Thy praise
Cast me not off at the time of old age
For mine enemies have spoken against me
Saying
O God
They are ashamed
And I continually do wait with hope
My mouth recounteth Thy righteousness
I come in the might of the Lord Jehovah
God
And also unto old age and grey hairs
And Thy righteousness
Because Thou hast showed me many and sad distresses
Thou dost increase my greatness
I also thank Thee with a vessel of psaltery
My lips cry aloud when I sing praise to Thee
My tongue also all the day uttereth Thy righteousness
