To the Overseer. -- By David. A fool hath said in his heart
Jehovah from the heavens Hath looked on the sons of men
The whole have turned aside
Have all working iniquity not known? Those consuming my people have eaten bread
There they have feared a fear
The counsel of the poor ye cause to stink
`Who doth give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When Jehovah doth turn back `To' a captivity of His people
