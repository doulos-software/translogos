To the Overseer with stringed instruments. -- An instruction
Attend to me
Because of the voice of an enemy
My heart is pained within me
Fear and trembling come in to me
And I say
Lo
I hasten escape for myself
Swallow up
By day and by night they go round it
Mischiefs `are' in its midst. Fraud and deceit depart not from its street."
For an enemy reproacheth me not
But thou
When together we sweeten counsel
Desolations `are' upon them
I -- to God I call
Evening
He hath ransomed in peace my soul From him who is near to me
God doth hear and afflict them
He hath sent forth his hands against his well-wishers
Sweeter than honey hath been his mouth
Cast on Jehovah that which He hath given thee
And Thou
