Why have nations tumultuously assembled? And do peoples meditate vanity?"
Station themselves do kings of the earth
`Let us draw off Their cords
He who is sitting in the heavens doth laugh
Then doth He speak unto them in His anger
`And I -- I have anointed My King
I declare concerning a statute: Jehovah said unto me
Ask of Me and I give nations -- thy inheritance
Thou dost rule them with a sceptre of iron
And now
Serve ye Jehovah with fear
Kiss the Chosen One
