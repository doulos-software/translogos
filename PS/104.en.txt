Bless
Covering himself `with' light as a garment
Who is laying the beam of His upper chambers in the waters
Making His messengers -- the winds
He hath founded earth on its bases
The abyss! as with clothing Thou hast covered it
From Thy rebuke they flee
They go up hills -- they go down valleys
A border Thou hast set
Who is sending forth fountains in valleys
They water every beast of the field
By them the fowl of the heavens doth dwell
Watering hills from His upper chambers
Causing grass to spring up for cattle
And wine -- it rejoiceth the heart of man
Satisfied `are' the trees of Jehovah
Where birds do make nests
The high hills `are' for wild goats
He made the moon for seasons
Thou settest darkness
The young lions are roaring for prey
The sun riseth
Man goeth forth to his work
How many have been Thy works
This
There do ships go: leviathan
All of them unto Thee do look
Thou dost give to them -- they gather
Thou hidest Thy face -- they are troubled
Thou sendest out Thy Spirit
The honour of Jehovah is to the age
Who is looking to earth
I sing to Jehovah during my life
Sweet is my meditation on Him
Consumed are sinners from the earth
