A Psalm of David. Kindness and judgment I sing
I act wisely in a perfect way
I set not before mine eyes a worthless thing
A perverse heart turneth aside from me
Whoso slandereth in secret his neighbour
Mine eyes are on the faithful of the land
He dwelleth not in my house who is working deceit
At morning I cut off all the wicked of the land
