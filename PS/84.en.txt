To the Overseer. -- `On the Gittith By sons of Korah.' -- A Psalm. How beloved Thy tabernacles
My soul desired
(Even a sparrow hath found a house
O the happiness of those inhabiting Thy house
O the happiness of a man whose strength is in Thee
Those passing through a valley of weeping
They go from strength unto strength
O Jehovah
Our shield
For good `is' a day in Thy courts
For a sun and a shield `is' Jehovah God
Jehovah of Hosts! O the happiness of a man trusting in Thee."
