Give ye thanks to Jehovah
I pray you
I pray you
I pray you
From the straitness I called Jah
Jehovah `is' for me
Jehovah `is' for me among my helpers
Better to take refuge in Jehovah than to trust in man
Better to take refuge in Jehovah
All nations have compassed me about
They have compassed me about
They compassed me about as bees
Thou hast sorely thrust me to fall
My strength and song `is' Jah
A voice of singing and salvation
The right hand of Jehovah is exalted
I do not die
Jah hath sorely chastened me
Open ye to me gates of righteousness
This `is' the gate to Jehovah
I thank Thee
A stone the builders refused Hath become head of a corner."
From Jehovah hath this been
This `is' the day Jehovah hath made
I beseech Thee
Blessed `is' he who is coming In the name of Jehovah
God `is' Jehovah
My God Thou `art'
Give ye thanks to Jehovah
