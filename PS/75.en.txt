To the Overseer. -- `Destroy not.' -- A Psalm of Asaph. -- A Song. We have given thanks to Thee
When I receive an appointment
Melted is the earth and all its inhabitants
I have said to the boastful
Raise not up on high your horn
For not from the east
But God `is' judge
For a cup `is' in the hand of Jehovah
And I -- I declare `it' to the age
And all horns of the wicked I cut off
