A Psalm of Asaph. Only -- good to Israel `is' God
As nothing
The peace of the wicked I see
And their might `is' firm."
In the misery of mortals they are not
Therefore hath pride encircled them
Their eye hath come out from fat. The imaginations of the heart transgressed;"
They do corruptly
They have set in the heavens their mouth
Therefore do His people return hither
And they have said
Lo
Only -- a vain thing! I have purified my heart
And I am plagued all the day
If I have said
And I think to know this
Till I come in to the sanctuaries of God
Only
How have they become a desolation as in a moment
As a dream from awakening
For my heart doth show itself violent
And I am brutish
And I `am' continually with Thee
With Thy counsel Thou dost lead me
Whom have I in the heavens? And with Thee none I have desired in earth."
Consumed hath been my flesh and my heart
For
And I -- nearness of God to me `is' good
