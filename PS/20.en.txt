To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. Jehovah doth answer thee
He doth send thy help from the sanctuary
He doth remember all thy presents
He doth give to thee according to thy heart
We sing of thy salvation
Now I have known That Jehovah hath saved His anointed
Some of chariots
They -- they have bowed and have fallen
O Jehovah
