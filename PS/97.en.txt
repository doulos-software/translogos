Jehovah hath reigned
Cloud and darkness `are' round about Him
Fire before Him goeth
Lightened have His lightnings the world
Hills
The heavens declared His righteousness
Ashamed are all servants of a graven image
Zion hath heard and rejoiceth
For Thou
Ye who love Jehovah
Light `is' sown for the righteous
Rejoice
