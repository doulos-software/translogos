A Psalm of David. The affirmation of Jehovah to my Lord: `Sit at My right hand
The rod of thy strength doth Jehovah send from Zion
Thy people `are' free-will gifts in the day of Thy strength
Jehovah hath sworn
The Lord on thy right hand smote kings In the day of His anger."
He doth judge among the nations
From a brook in the way he drinketh
