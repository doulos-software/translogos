`Give ye thanks to Jehovah
Let the redeemed of Jehovah say
And from the lands hath gathered them
They wandered in a wilderness
Hungry -- yea -- thirsty
And they cry unto Jehovah in their adversity
And causeth them to tread in a right way
They confess to Jehovah His kindness
For He hath satisfied a longing soul
Inhabitants of dark places and death-shade
Because they changed the saying of God
And He humbleth with labour their heart
And they cry unto Jehovah in their adversity
He bringeth them out from the dark place
They confess to Jehovah His kindness
For He hath broken doors of brass
Fools
All food doth their soul abominate
And cry unto Jehovah in their adversity
He sendeth His word and healeth them
They confess to Jehovah His kindness
And they sacrifice sacrifices of thanksgiving
Those going down `to' the sea in ships
They have seen the works of Jehovah
And He saith
They go up `to' the heavens
They reel to and fro
And they cry to Jehovah in their adversity
He establisheth a whirlwind to a calm
And they rejoice because they are quiet
They confess to Jehovah His kindness
And they exalt Him in the assembly of the people
He maketh rivers become a wilderness
A fruitful land becometh a barren place
He maketh a wilderness become a pool of water
And He causeth the hungry to dwell there
And they sow fields
And He blesseth them
And they are diminished
He is pouring contempt upon nobles
And setteth on high the needy from affliction
The upright do see and rejoice
Who `is' wise
