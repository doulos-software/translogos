To the Overseer. -- `Destroy not.' -- A secret treasure
Even in heart ye work iniquities
The wicked have been estranged from the womb
Their poison `is' as poison of a serpent
Which hearkeneth not to the voice of whisperers
O God
They are melted as waters
As a snail that melteth he goeth on
Before your pots discern the bramble
The righteous rejoiceth that he hath seen vengeance
And man saith: `Surely fruit `is' for the righteous: Surely there is a God judging in the earth!'"
