To the Overseer
My God
And Thou `art' holy
In Thee did our fathers trust -- they trusted
Unto Thee they cried
And I `am' a worm
All beholding me do mock at me
`Roll unto Jehovah
For thou `art' He bringing me forth from the womb
On Thee I have been cast from the womb
Be not far from me
Many bulls have surrounded me
They have opened against me their mouth
As waters I have been poured out
Dried up as an earthen vessel is my power
And to the dust of death thou appointest me
I count all my bones -- they look expectingly
They apportion my garments to themselves
And Thou
Deliver from the sword my soul
Save me from the mouth of a lion: -- And -- from the horns of the high places Thou hast answered me!"
I declare Thy name to my brethren
Ye who fear Jehovah
For He hath not despised
Of Thee my praise `is' in the great assembly. My vows I complete before His fearers."
The humble do eat and are satisfied
Remember and return unto Jehovah
For to Jehovah `is' the kingdom
And the fat ones of earth have eaten
A seed doth serve Him
They come and declare His righteousness
