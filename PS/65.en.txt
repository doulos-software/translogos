To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. A Song. To Thee
Hearer of prayer
Matters of iniquities were mightier than I
O the happiness of `him whom' Thou choosest
By fearful things in righteousness Thou answerest us
Establishing mountains by His power
Restraining the noise of seas
And the inhabitants of the uttermost parts From Thy signs are afraid
Thou hast inspected the earth
Its ridges have been filled
Thou hast crowned the year of Thy goodness
Drop do the pastures of a wilderness
Clothed have lambs the flock
