To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. An Instruction. O God
Thou
For
Thou `art' He
By Thee our adversaries we do push
For
For Thou hast saved us from our adversaries
In God we have boasted all the day
In anger Thou hast cast off and causest us to blush
Thou causest us to turn backward from an adversary
Thou makest us food like sheep
Thou sellest Thy people -- without wealth
Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours
Thou makest us a simile among nations
All the day my confusion `is' before me
Because of the voice of a reproacher and reviler
All this met us
We turn not backward our heart
But Thou hast smitten us in a place of dragons
If we have forgotten the name of our God
Doth not God search out this? For He knoweth the secrets of the heart."
Surely
Stir up -- why dost Thou sleep
Why Thy face hidest Thou? Thou forgettest our afflictions and our oppression
For bowed to the dust hath our soul
Arise
