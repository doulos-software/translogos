Praise ye Jah
Who doth utter the mighty acts of Jehovah? Soundeth all His praise?"
O the happiness of those keeping judgment
Remember me
To look on the good of Thy chosen ones
We have sinned with our fathers
Our fathers in Egypt
And He saveth them for His name's sake
And rebuketh the sea of Suph
And He saveth them from the hand Of him who is hating
And waters cover their adversaries
And they believe in His words
They have hasted -- forgotten His works
And they lust greatly in a wilderness
And He giveth to them their request
And they are envious of Moses in the camp
Earth openeth
And fire burneth among their company
They make a calf in Horeb
And change their Honour Into the form of an ox eating herbs."
They have forgotten God their saviour
Of wonderful things in the land of Ham
And He saith to destroy them
And they kick against the desirable land
And they murmur in their tents
And He lifteth up His hand to them
And to cause their seed to fall among nations
And they are coupled to Baal-Peor
And they provoke to anger by their actions
And Phinehas standeth
And it is reckoned to him to righteousness
And they cause wrath by the waters of Meribah
For they have provoked his spirit
They have not destroyed the peoples
And mix themselves among nations
And serve their idols
And they sacrifice their sons And their daughters to destroyers
And they shed innocent blood -- Blood of their sons and of their daughters
And they are defiled with their works
And the anger of Jehovah Is kindled against His people
And giveth them into the hand of nations
And their enemies oppress them
Many times He doth deliver them
And He looketh on their distress When He heareth their cry
And remembereth for them His covenant
And He appointeth them for mercies Before all their captors."
Save us
Blessed `is' Jehovah
