A Psalm of David
For Thine arrows have come down on me
Soundness is not in my flesh
For mine iniquities have passed over my head
Stunk -- become corrupt have my wounds
I have been bent down
For my flanks have been full of drought
I have been feeble and smitten -- unto excess
Lord
My heart `is' panting
My lovers and my friends over-against my plague stand. And my neighbours afar off have stood."
And those seeking my soul lay a snare
And I
Yea
Because for Thee
When I said
For I am ready to halt
For mine iniquity I declare
And mine enemies `are' lively
And those paying evil for good accuse me
Do not forsake me
Haste to help me
