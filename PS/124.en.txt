A Song of the Ascents
Save `for' Jehovah -- who hath been for us
Then alive they had swallowed us up
Then the waters had overflowed us
Then passed over our soul had the proud waters."
Blessed `is' Jehovah who hath not given us
Our soul as a bird hath escaped from a snare of fowlers
Our help `is' in the name of Jehovah
