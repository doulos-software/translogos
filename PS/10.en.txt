Why
Through the pride of the wicked
Because the wicked hath boasted Of the desire of his soul
The wicked according to the height of his face
Pain do his ways at all times
He hath said in his heart
Of oaths his mouth is full
He doth sit in an ambush of the villages
He lieth in wait in a secret place
He is bruised -- he boweth down
He said in his heart
Arise
Wherefore hath the wicked despised God? He hath said in his heart
Thou hast seen
Break the arm of the wicked and the evil
Jehovah `is' king to the age
The desire of the humble Thou hast heard
To judge the fatherless and bruised: He addeth no more to oppress -- man of the earth!"
