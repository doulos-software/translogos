A Psalm of David
So in the sanctuary I have seen Thee
Because better `is' Thy kindness than life
So I bless Thee in my life
As `with' milk and fatness is my soul satisfied
If I have remembered Thee on my couch
For Thou hast been a help to me
Cleaved hath my soul after Thee
And they who for desolation seek my soul
They cause him to run on the edge of the sword
And the king doth rejoice in God
