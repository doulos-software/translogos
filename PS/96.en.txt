Sing to Jehovah a new song
Sing to Jehovah
Declare among nations His honour
For great `is' Jehovah
For all the gods of the peoples `are' nought
Honour and majesty `are' before Him
Ascribe to Jehovah
Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name
Bow yourselves to Jehovah
Say among nations
The heavens joy
The field exulteth
Before Jehovah
