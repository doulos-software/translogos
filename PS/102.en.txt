A Prayer of the afflicted when he is feeble
Hide not Thou Thy face from me
For consumed in smoke have been my days
Smitten as the herb
From the voice of my sighing Hath my bone cleaved to my flesh."
I have been like to a pelican of the wilderness
I have watched
All the day mine enemies reproached me
Because ashes as bread I have eaten
From Thine indignation and Thy wrath
My days as a shadow `are' stretched out
And Thou
Thou -- Thou risest -- Thou pitiest Zion
For Thy servants have been pleased with her stones
And nations fear the name of Jehovah
For Jehovah hath builded Zion
He turned unto the prayer of the destitute
This is written for a later generation
For He hath looked From the high place of His sanctuary. Jehovah from heaven unto earth looked attentively
To hear the groan of the prisoner
To declare in Zion the name of Jehovah
In the peoples being gathered together
He hath humbled in the way my power
I say
Beforetime the earth Thou didst found
They -- They perish
And Thou `art' the same
The sons of Thy servants do continue
