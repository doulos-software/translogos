To the Overseer. -- `On the Gittith.' By Asaph. Cry aloud to God our strength
Lift up a song
Blow in the month a trumpet
For a statute to Israel it `is'
A testimony on Joseph He hath placed it
From the burden his shoulder I turned aside
In distress thou hast called and I deliver thee
Hear
There is not in thee a strange god
I `am' Jehovah thy God
But
And I send them away in the enmity of their heart
O that My people were hearkening to Me
As a little thing their enemies I cause to bow
Those hating Jehovah feign obedience to Him
He causeth him to eat of the fat of wheat
