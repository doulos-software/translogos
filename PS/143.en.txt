A Psalm of David. O Jehovah
And enter not into judgment with Thy servant
For an enemy hath pursued my soul
And my spirit in me is become feeble
I have remembered days of old
I have spread forth my hands unto Thee
Haste
Cause me to hear in the morning Thy kindness
Deliver me from mine enemies
Teach me to do Thy good pleasure
For Thy name's sake O Jehovah
And in Thy kindness cuttest off mine enemies
