To the Overseer with stringed instruments. -- A Psalm of Asaph. -- A Song. In Judah `is' God known
And His tabernacle is in Salem
There he hath shivered arrows of a bow
Bright `art' Thou
Spoiled themselves have the mighty of heart
From Thy rebuke
Thou
From heaven Thou hast sounded judgment
In the rising of God to judgment
For the fierceness of man praiseth Thee
Vow and complete to Jehovah your God
He doth gather the spirit of leaders
