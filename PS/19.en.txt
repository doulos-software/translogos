To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. The heavens `are' recounting the honour of God
Day to day uttereth speech
There is no speech
Into all the earth hath their line gone forth
And he
From the end of the heavens `is' his going out
The law of Jehovah `is' perfect
The precepts of Jehovah `are' upright
The fear of Jehovah `is' clean
They are more desirable than gold
Also -- Thy servant is warned by them
Errors! who doth understand? From hidden ones declare me innocent
Also -- from presumptuous ones keep back Thy servant
Let the sayings of my mouth
