To the Overseer. -- By a servant of Jehovah
For he made `it' smooth to himself in his eyes
The words of his mouth `are' iniquity and deceit
Iniquity he deviseth on his bed
O Jehovah
Thy righteousness `is' as mountains of God
How precious `is' Thy kindness
They are filled from the fatness of Thy house
For with Thee `is' a fountain of life
Draw out Thy kindness to those knowing Thee
Let not a foot of pride meet me
There have workers of iniquity fallen
