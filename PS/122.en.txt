A Song of the Ascents
Our feet have been standing in thy gates
Jerusalem -- the builded one -- `Is' as a city that is joined to itself together."
For thither have tribes gone up
For there have sat thrones of judgment
Ask ye the peace of Jerusalem
Peace is in thy bulwark
For the sake of my brethren and my companions
For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God
