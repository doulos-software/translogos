By David. Blessed `is' Jehovah my rock
My kind one
Jehovah
Man to vanity hath been like
Jehovah
Send forth lightning
Send forth Thy hand from on high
Because their mouth hath spoken vanity
O God
Who is giving deliverance to kings
Free me
Because our sons `are' as plants
Our garners `are' full
Our oxen are carrying
O the happiness of the people that is thus
