To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. Deliver me
Who have devised evils in the heart
They sharpened their tongue as a serpent
Preserve me
The proud hid a snare for me -- and cords
I have said to Jehovah
O Jehovah
Grant not
The chief of my surrounders
They cause to fall on themselves burning coals
A talkative man is not established in the earth
I have known that Jehovah doth execute The judgment of the afflicted
Only -- the righteous give thanks to Thy name
