A Psalm of David. Ascribe to Jehovah
Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name
The voice of Jehovah `is' on the waters
The voice of Jehovah `is' with power
The voice of Jehovah `is' shivering cedars
And He causeth them to skip as a calf
The voice of Jehovah is hewing fiery flames
The voice of Jehovah paineth a wilderness
The voice of Jehovah paineth the oaks
Jehovah on the deluge hath sat
Jehovah strength to his people giveth
