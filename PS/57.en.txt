To the Overseer. -- `Destroy not.' -- A secret treasure of David
I call to God Most High
He sendeth from the heaven
My soul `is' in the midst of lions
Be Thou exalted above the heavens
A net they have prepared for my steps
Prepared is my heart
Awake
I thank Thee among the peoples
For great unto the heavens `is' Thy kindness
Be thou exalted above the heavens
