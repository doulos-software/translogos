To the Overseer. -- `On the Lilies
I have sunk in deep mire
I have been wearied with my calling
Those hating me without cause Have been more than the hairs of my head
O God
Let not those waiting on Thee be ashamed because of me
For because of Thee I have borne reproach
A stranger I have been to my brother
For zeal for Thy house hath consumed me
And I weep in the fasting of my soul
And I make my clothing sackcloth
Those sitting at the gate meditate concerning me
And I -- my prayer `is' to Thee
Deliver me from the mire
Let not a flood of waters overflow me
Answer me
And hide not Thy face from Thy servant
Be near unto my soul -- redeem it
Thou -- Thou hast known my reproach
Reproach hath broken my heart
And they give for my food gall
Their table before them is for a snare
Darkened are their eyes from seeing
Pour upon them Thine indignation
Their tower is desolated
For they have pursued him Thou hast smitten
Give punishment for their iniquity
They are blotted out of the book of life
And I `am' afflicted and pained
I praise the name of God with a song
And it is better to Jehovah than an ox
The humble have seen -- they rejoice
For Jehovah hearkeneth unto the needy
The heavens and earth do praise Him
For God doth save Zion
And the seed of His servants inherit it
