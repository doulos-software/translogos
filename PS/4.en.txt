To the Overseer with Stringed Instruments. -- A Psalm of David. In my calling answer Thou me
Sons of men! till when `is' my glory for shame? Ye love a vain thing
And know ye that Jehovah Hath separated a saintly one to Himself. Jehovah heareth in my calling to Him."
`Tremble ye
Sacrifice ye sacrifices of righteousness
Many are saying
Thou hast given joy in my heart
In peace together I lie down and sleep
