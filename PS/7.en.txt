`The Erring One
Lest he tear as a lion my soul
O Jehovah
If I have done my well-wisher evil
An enemy pursueth my soul
Rise
And a company of peoples compass Thee
Jehovah doth judge the peoples; Judge me
Let
My shield `is' on God
God `is' a righteous judge
If `one' turn not
Yea
Lo
A pit he hath prepared
Return doth his perverseness on his head
I thank Jehovah
