To the Overseer
From the mouths of infants and sucklings Thou hast founded strength
For I see Thy heavens
What `is' man that Thou rememberest him? The son of man that Thou inspectest him?"
And causest him to lack a little of Godhead
Thou dost cause him to rule Over the works of Thy hands
Sheep and oxen
Bird of the heavens
Jehovah
