A Secret Treasure of David. Preserve me
Thou hast said to Jehovah
For the holy ones who `are' in the land
Multiplied are their griefs
Jehovah `is' the portion of my share
Lines have fallen to me in pleasant places
I bless Jehovah who hath counselled me; Also `in' the nights my reins instruct me."
I did place Jehovah before me continually
Therefore hath my heart been glad
For Thou dost not leave my soul to Sheol
Thou causest me to know the path of life; Fulness of joys `is' with Thy presence
