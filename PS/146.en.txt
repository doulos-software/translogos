Praise ye Jah! Praise
I praise Jehovah during my life
Trust not in princes -- in a son of man
His spirit goeth forth
O the happiness of him Who hath the God of Jacob for his help
Making the heavens and earth
Doing judgment for the oppressed
Jehovah is loosing the prisoners
Jehovah is preserving the strangers
Jehovah doth reign to the age
