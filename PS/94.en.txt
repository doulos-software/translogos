God of vengeance -- Jehovah! God of vengeance
Be lifted up
Till when `do' the wicked
They utter -- they speak an old saw
Thy people
Widow and sojourner they slay
And they say
Consider
He who planteth the ear doth He not hear? He who formeth the eye doth He not see?"
He who is instructing nations
He knoweth the thoughts of man
O the happiness of the man Whom Thou instructest
To give rest to him from days of evil
For Jehovah leaveth not His people
For to righteousness judgment turneth back
Who riseth up for me with evil doers? Who stationeth himself for me with workers of iniquity?"
Unless Jehovah `were' a help to me
If I have said
In the abundance of my thoughts within me
Is a throne of mischief joined `with' Thee? A framer of perverseness by statute?"
They decree against the soul of the righteous
And Jehovah is for a high place to me
And turneth back on them their iniquity
