By David
In Jehovah doth my soul boast herself
Ascribe ye greatness to Jehovah with me
I sought Jehovah
They looked expectingly unto Him
This poor `one' called
A messenger of Jehovah is encamping
Taste ye and see that Jehovah `is' good
Fear Jehovah
Young lions have lacked and been hungry
Come ye
Who `is' the man that is desiring life? Loving days to see good?"
Keep thy tongue from evil
Turn aside from evil and do good
The eyes of Jehovah `are' unto the righteous
(The face of Jehovah `is' on doers of evil
They cried
Near `is' Jehovah to the broken of heart
Many `are' the evils of the righteous
He is keeping all his bones
Evil doth put to death the wicked
Jehovah redeemeth the soul of His servants
