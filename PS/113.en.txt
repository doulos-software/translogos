Praise ye Jah! Praise
The name of Jehovah is blessed
From the rising of the sun unto its going in
High above all nations `is' Jehovah
Who `is' as Jehovah our God
He is humbling `Himself' to look On the heavens and on the earth."
He is raising up from the dust the poor
To cause to sit with princes
Causing the barren one of the house to sit
