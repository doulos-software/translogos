A Psalm of David. To Jehovah `is' the earth and its fulness
For He on the seas hath founded it
Who goeth up into the hill of Jehovah? And who riseth up in His holy place?"
The clean of hands
He beareth away a blessing from Jehovah
This `is' a generation of those seeking Him. Seeking Thy face
Lift up
Who `is' this -- `the king of glory?' Jehovah -- strong and mighty
Lift up
Who `is' He -- this `king of glory?' Jehovah of hosts -- He `is' the king of glory! Selah."
