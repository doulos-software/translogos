Give ye thanks to Jehovah
Give ye thanks to the God of gods
Give ye thanks to the Lord of lords
To Him doing great wonders by Himself alone
To Him making the heavens by understanding
To Him spreading the earth over the waters
To Him making great lights
The sun to rule by day
The moon and stars to rule by night
To Him smiting Egypt in their first-born
And bringing forth Israel from their midst
By a strong hand
To Him cutting the sea of Suph into parts
And caused Israel to pass through its midst
And shook out Pharaoh and his force in the sea of Suph
To Him leading His people in a wilderness
To Him smiting great kings
Yea
Even Sihon king of the Amorite
And Og king of Bashan
And He gave their land for inheritance
An inheritance to Israel His servant
Who in our lowliness hath remembered us
And He delivereth us from our adversaries
Giving food to all flesh
Give ye thanks to the God of the heavens
