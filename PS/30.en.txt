A Psalm. -- A song of the dedication of the house of David. I exalt Thee
Jehovah my God
Jehovah
Sing praise to Jehovah
For -- a moment `is' in His anger
And I -- I have said in mine ease
O Jehovah
Unto Thee
`What gain `is' in my blood? In my going down unto corruption? Doth dust thank Thee? doth it declare Thy truth?"
Hear
Thou hast turned my mourning to dancing for me
So that honour doth praise Thee
