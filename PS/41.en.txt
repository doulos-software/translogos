To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. O the happiness of him Who is acting wisely unto the poor
Jehovah doth preserve him and revive him
Jehovah supporteth on a couch of sickness
I -- I said
Mine enemies say evil of me: When he dieth -- his name hath perished!"
And if he came to see -- vanity he speaketh
All hating me whisper together against me
A thing of Belial is poured out on him
Even mine ally
And Thou
By this I have known
As to me
Blessed `is' Jehovah
