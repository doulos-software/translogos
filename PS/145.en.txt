Praise by David. I exalt Thee
Every day do I bless Thee
Great `is' Jehovah
Generation to generation praiseth Thy works
The honour -- the glory of Thy majesty
And the strength of Thy fearful acts they tell
The memorial of the abundance of Thy goodness they send forth. And Thy righteousness they sing."
Gracious and merciful `is' Jehovah
Good `is' Jehovah to all
Confess Thee O Jehovah
The honour of Thy kingdom they tell
To make known to sons of men His mighty acts
Thy kingdom `is' a kingdom of all ages
Jehovah is supporting all who are falling
The eyes of all unto Thee do look
Opening Thy hand
Righteous `is' Jehovah in all His ways
Near `is' Jehovah to all those calling Him
The desire of those fearing Him He doth
Jehovah preserveth all those loving Him
The praise of Jehovah my mouth speaketh
