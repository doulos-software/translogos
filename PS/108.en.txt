A Song
Awake
I thank Thee among peoples
For great above the heavens `is' Thy kindness
Be Thou exalted above the heavens
That Thy beloved ones may be delivered
God hath spoken in His holiness: I exult
Mine `is' Gilead
Moab `is' a pot for my washing
Who doth bring me in to the fenced city? Who hath led me unto Edom?"
Hast not Thou
Give to us help from adversity
In God we do mightily
