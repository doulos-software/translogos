To the Overseer. -- `On the Lilies.' A testimony of Asaph. -- A Psalm. Shepherd of Israel
Before Ephraim
O God
Jehovah
Thou hast caused them to eat bread of tears
Thou makest us a strife to our neighbors
God of Hosts
A vine out of Egypt Thou dost bring
Thou hast looked before it
Covered have been hills `with' its shadow
It sendeth forth its branches unto the sea
Why hast Thou broken down its hedges
A boar out of the forest doth waste it
God of Hosts
And the root that Thy right hand planted
Burnt with fire -- cut down
Let Thy hand be on the man of Thy right hand
And we do not go back from Thee
O Jehovah
