An Instruction of Asaph. Why
Remember Thy company. Thou didst purchase of old
Lift up Thy steps to the perpetual desolations
Roared have thine adversaries
He is known as one bringing in on high Against a thicket of wood -- axes."
And now
They have sent into fire Thy sanctuary
They said in their hearts
Our ensigns we have not seen
Till when
Why dost Thou turn back Thy hand
And God `is' my king of old
Thou hast broken by Thy strength a sea-`monster'
Thou hast broken the heads of leviathan
Thou hast cleaved a fountain and a stream
Thine `is' the day
Thou hast set up all the borders of earth
Remember this -- an enemy reproached Jehovah
Give not up to a company
Look attentively to the covenant
Let not the oppressed turn back ashamed
Arise
Forget not the voice of Thine adversaries
