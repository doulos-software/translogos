Sing
Give ye thanks to Jehovah with a harp
Sing ye to Him a new song
For upright `is' the word of Jehovah
Loving righteousness and judgment
By the word of Jehovah The heavens have been made
Gathering as a heap the waters of the sea
Afraid of Jehovah are all the earth
For He hath said
Jehovah made void the counsel of nations
The counsel of Jehovah to the age standeth
O the happiness of the nation whose God `is' Jehovah
From the heavens hath Jehovah looked
From the fixed place of His dwelling
Who is forming their hearts together
The king is not saved by the multitude of a force. A mighty man is not delivered
A false thing `is' the horse for safety
Lo
To deliver from death their soul
Our soul hath waited for Jehovah
For in Him doth our heart rejoice
Let Thy kindness
