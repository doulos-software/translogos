To the Overseer. -- An Instruction. By sons of Korah. As a hart doth pant for streams of water
My soul thirsted for God
My tear hath been to me bread day and night
These I remember
What! bowest thou thyself
In me doth my soul bow itself
Deep unto deep is calling At the noise of Thy water-spouts
By day Jehovah commandeth His kindness
I say to God my rock
With a sword in my bones Have mine adversaries reproached me
What! bowest thou thyself
