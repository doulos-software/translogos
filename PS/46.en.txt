To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. `For the Virgins.' -- A song. God `is' to us a refuge and strength
Therefore we fear not in the changing of earth
Roar -- troubled are its waters
A river -- its rivulets rejoice the city of God
God `is' in her midst -- she is not moved
Troubled have been nations
Jehovah of Hosts `is' with us
Come ye
Causing wars to cease
Desist
Jehovah of hosts `is' with us
