By Solomon. O God
He judgeth Thy people with righteousness
The mountains bear peace to the people
He judgeth the poor of the people
They fear Thee with the sun
He cometh down as rain on mown grass
Flourish in his days doth the righteous
And he ruleth from sea unto sea
Before him bow do the inhabitants of the dry places
Kings of Tarshish and of the isles send back a present. Kings of Sheba and Seba a reward bring near."
And all kings do bow themselves to him
For he delivereth the needy who crieth
He hath pity on the poor and needy
From fraud and from violence he redeemeth their soul
And he liveth
There is a handful of corn in the earth
His name is to the age
Blessed is Jehovah God
And blessed `is' the Name of His honour to the age
The prayers of David son of Jesse have been ended."
