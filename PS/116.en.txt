I have loved
Because He hath inclined His ear to me
Compassed me have cords of death
And in the name of Jehovah I call: I pray Thee
Gracious `is' Jehovah
A preserver of the simple `is' Jehovah
Turn back
For Thou hast delivered my soul from death
I walk habitually before Jehovah In the lands of the living."
I have believed
I said in my haste
What do I return to Jehovah? All His benefits `are' upon me."
The cup of salvation I lift up
My vows to Jehovah let me complete
Precious in the eyes of Jehovah `is' the death for His saints."
Cause `it' to come
To Thee I sacrifice a sacrifice of thanks
My vows to Jehovah let me complete
In the courts of the house of Jehovah
