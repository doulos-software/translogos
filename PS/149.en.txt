Praise ye Jah! Sing ye to Jehovah a new song
Israel doth rejoice in his Maker
They praise His name in a dance
For Jehovah is pleased with His people
Exult do saints in honour
The exaltation of God `is' in their throat
To do vengeance among nations
To bind their kings with chains
To do among them the judgment written
