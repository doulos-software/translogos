Who is forgiving all thine iniquities
Who is redeeming from destruction thy life
Who is satisfying with good thy desire
Jehovah is doing righteousness and judgments For all the oppressed."
He maketh known His ways to Moses
Merciful and gracious `is' Jehovah
Not for ever doth He strive
Not according to our sins hath He done to us
For
As the distance of east from west He hath put far from us our transgressions."
As a father hath mercy on sons
For He hath known our frame
Mortal man! as grass `are' his days
For a wind hath passed over it
And the kindness of Jehovah `Is' from age even unto age on those fearing Him
To those keeping His covenant
Jehovah in the heavens Hath established His throne
Bless Jehovah
Bless Jehovah
Bless Jehovah
