A Psalm. -- A Song for the sabbath-day. Good to give thanks to Jehovah
To declare in the morning Thy kindness
On ten strings and on psaltery
For Thou hast caused me to rejoice
How great have been Thy works
A brutish man doth not know
When the wicked flourish as a herb
And Thou `art' high to the age
For
And Thou exaltest as a reem my horn
And mine eye looketh on mine enemies
The righteous as a palm-tree flourisheth
Those planted in the house of Jehovah
Still they bring forth in old age
To declare that upright `is' Jehovah my rock
