Come
We come before His face with thanksgiving
For a great God `is' Jehovah
In whose hand `are' the deep places of earth
Whose is the sea
Come in
For He `is' our God
Harden not your heart as `in' Meribah
Where your fathers have tried Me
Forty years I am weary of the generation
Where I sware in Mine anger
