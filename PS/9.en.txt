To the Overseer
I rejoice and exult in Thee
In mine enemies turning backward
For Thou hast done my judgment and my right. Thou hast sat on a throne
Thou hast rebuked nations
O thou Enemy
And Jehovah to the age abideth
And He judgeth the world in righteousness
And Jehovah is a tower for the bruised
They trust in Thee who do know Thy name
Sing ye praise to Jehovah
For He who is seeking for blood Them hath remembered
Favour me
So that I recount all Thy praise
Sunk have nations in a pit they made
Jehovah hath been known
The wicked do turn back to Sheol
For not for ever is the needy forgotten
Rise
Appoint
