To the Overseer with stringed instruments
Favour me
And my soul hath been troubled greatly
Turn back
For there is not in death Thy memorial
I have been weary with my sighing
Old from provocation is mine eye
Turn from me all ye workers of iniquity
Jehovah hath heard my supplication
Ashamed and troubled greatly are all mine enemies
