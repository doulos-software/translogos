A Song
My prayer cometh in before Thee
For my soul hath been full of evils
I have been reckoned with those going down `to' the pit
Among the dead -- free
Thou hast put me in the lowest pit
Upon me hath Thy fury lain
Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me
Mine eye hath grieved because of affliction
To the dead dost Thou do wonders? Do Rephaim rise? do they thank Thee? Selah."
Is Thy kindness recounted in the grave? Thy faithfulness in destruction?"
Are Thy wonders known in the darkness? And Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?"
And I
Why
I `am' afflicted
Over me hath Thy wrath passed
They have surrounded me as waters all the day
Thou hast put far from me lover and friend
