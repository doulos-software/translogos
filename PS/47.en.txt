To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. A Psalm. All ye peoples
For Jehovah Most High `is' fearful
He leadeth peoples under us
He doth choose for us our inheritance
God hath gone up with a shout
Praise God -- praise -- give praise to our king
For king of all the earth `is' God
God hath reigned over nations
Nobles of peoples have been gathered
