An instruction
For I said
I have made a covenant for My chosen
`Even to the age do I establish thy seed
and the heavens confess Thy wonders
For who in the sky
God is very terrible
O Jehovah
Thou `art' ruler over the pride of the sea
Thou hast bruised Rahab
Thine `are' the heavens -- the earth also `is' Thine
North and south Thou hast appointed them
Thou hast an arm with might
Righteousness and judgment `Are' the fixed place of Thy throne
O the happiness of the people knowing the shout
In Thy name they rejoice all the day
For the beauty of their strength `art' Thou
For of Jehovah `is' our shield
Then Thou hast spoken in vision
I have found David My servant
With whom My hand is established
An enemy exacteth not upon him
And I have beaten down before him his adversaries
And My faithfulness and kindness `are' with him
And I have set on the sea his hand
He proclaimeth me: `Thou `art' my Father
I also first-born do appoint him
To the age I keep for him My kindness
And I have set his seed for ever
If his sons forsake My law
If My statutes they pollute
I have looked after with a rod their transgression
And My kindness I break not from him
I profane not My covenant
Once I have sworn by My holiness
His seed is to the age
As the moon it is established -- to the age
And Thou
Hast rejected the covenant of Thy servant
Thou hast broken down all his hedges
Spoiled him have all passing by the way
Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries
Also -- Thou turnest back the sharpness of his sword
Hast caused `him' to cease from his brightness
Thou hast shortened the days of his youth
Till when
Remember
Who `is' the man that liveth
Where `are' Thy former kindnesses
Remember
Wherewith Thine enemies reproached
Blessed `is' Jehovah to the age. Amen
