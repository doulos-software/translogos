To the Overseer. -- By a servant of Jehovah
Jehovah `is' my rock
The `Praised One' I call Jehovah
Compassed me have cords of death
Cords of Sheol have surrounded me
In mine adversity I call Jehovah
And shake and tremble doth the earth
Gone up hath smoke by His nostrils
And He inclineth the heavens
And He rideth on a cherub
He maketh darkness His secret place
From the brightness over-against Him His thick clouds have passed on
And thunder in the heavens doth Jehovah
And He sendeth His arrows and scattereth them
And seen are the streams of waters
He sendeth from above -- He taketh me
He delivereth me from my strong enemy
They go before me in a day of my calamity And Jehovah is for a support to me."
And He bringeth me forth to a large place
Jehovah doth recompense me According to my righteousness
For I have kept the ways of Jehovah
For all His judgments `are' before me
And I am perfect with him
And Jehovah doth return to me
With the kind Thou showest Thyself kind
With the pure Thou showest Thyself pure
For Thou a poor people savest
For Thou -- Thou lightest my lamp
For by Thee I run -- a troop! And by my God I leap a wall."
God! perfect `is' His way
For who `is' God besides Jehovah? And who `is' a rock save our God?"
God! who is girding me `with' strength
Making my feet like hinds
Teaching my hands for battle
And Thou givest to me the shield of Thy salvation
Thou enlargest my step under me
I pursue mine enemies
I smite them
And Thou girdest me `with' strength for battle
As to mine enemies -- Thou hast given to me the neck
They cry
And I beat them as dust before wind
Thou dost deliver me From the strivings of the people
At the hearing of the ear they hearken to me
Sons of a stranger fade away
Jehovah liveth -- and blessed `is' my rock
God -- who is giving vengeance to me
My deliverer from mine enemies
Therefore I confess Thee among nations
Magnifying the salvation of His king
