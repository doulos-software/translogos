To the Overseer. -- `Destroy not
Deliver me from workers of iniquity
For
Without punishment they run and prepare themselves
And Thou
They turn back at evening
Lo
And Thou
O my Strength
God doth go before me
Slay them not
The sin of their mouth `is' a word of their lips
Consume in fury
And they turn back at evening
They -- they wander for food
And I -- I sing `of' Thy strength
O my Strength
