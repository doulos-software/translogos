To the Overseer. -- `On the Lilies.' -- By sons of Korah. -- An Instruction. -- A song of loves. My heart hath indited a good thing
Thou hast been beautified above the sons of men
Gird Thy sword upon the thigh
As to Thy majesty -- prosper! -- ride! Because of truth
Thine arrows `are' sharp
Thy throne
Thou hast loved righteousness and hatest wickedness
Myrrh and aloes
Daughters of kings `are' among thy precious ones
Hearken
And the king doth desire thy beauty
And the daughter of Tyre with a present
All glory `is' the daughter of the king within
In divers colours she is brought to the king
They are brought with joy and gladness
Instead of thy fathers are thy sons
I make mention of Thy name in all generations
