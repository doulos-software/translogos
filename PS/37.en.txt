By David. Do not fret because of evil doers
For as grass speedily they are cut off
Trust in Jehovah
And delight thyself on Jehovah
Roll on Jehovah thy way
And hath brought out as light thy righteousness
Be silent for Jehovah
Desist from anger
For evil doers are cut off
And yet a little
And the humble do possess the land
The wicked is devising against the righteous
The Lord doth laugh at him
A sword have the wicked opened
Their sword doth enter into their own heart
Better `is' the little of the righteous
For the arms of the wicked are shivered
Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect
They are not ashamed in a time of evil
But the wicked perish
The wicked is borrowing and repayeth not
For His blessed ones do possess the land
From Jehovah `are' the steps of a man
When he falleth
Young I have been
All the day he is gracious and lending
Turn aside from evil
For Jehovah is loving judgment
The righteous possess the land
The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom
The law of his God `is' his heart
The wicked is watching for the righteous
Jehovah doth not leave him in his hand
Look unto Jehovah
I have seen the wicked terrible
And he passeth away
Observe the perfect
And transgressors were destroyed together
And the salvation of the righteous `is' from Jehovah
And Jehovah doth help them and deliver them
