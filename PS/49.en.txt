To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. A Psalm. Hear this
Both low and high
My mouth speaketh wise things
I incline to a simile mine ear
Why do I fear in days of evil? The iniquity of my supplanters doth compass me."
Those trusting on their wealth
A brother doth no one at all ransom
And precious `is' the redemption of their soul
And still he liveth for ever
For he seeth wise men die
Their heart `is': Their houses `are' to the age
And man in honour doth not remain
This their way `is' folly for them
As sheep for Sheol they have set themselves
Only
Fear not
For at his death he receiveth nothing
For his soul in his life he blesseth
It cometh to the generation of his fathers
Man in honour
