Praise ye Jah! O the happiness of one fearing Jehovah
Mighty in the earth is his seed
Wealth and riches `are' in his house
Light hath risen in darkness to the upright
Good `is' the man -- gracious and lending
For -- to the age he is not moved; For a memorial age-during is the righteous."
Of an evil report he is not afraid
Sustained is his heart -- he feareth not
He hath scattered -- hath given to the needy
The wicked seeth
