A Prayer of David. Hear
From before thee my judgment doth go out; Thine eyes do see uprightly."
Thou hast proved my heart
As to doings of man
To uphold my goings in Thy paths
I -- I called Thee
Separate wonderfully Thy kindness
Keep me as the apple
From the face of the wicked who spoiled me. Mine enemies in soul go round against me."
Their fat they have closed up
`Our steps now have compassed `him';' Their eyes they set to turn aside in the land."
His likeness as a lion desirous to tear
Arise
From men
I -- in righteousness
