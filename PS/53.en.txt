To the Overseer. -- `On a disease.' -- An instruction
God from the heavens looked on the sons of men
Every one went back
Have not workers of iniquity known
There they feared a fear -- there was no fear
Who doth give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When God turneth back `to' a captivity of His people
