A Psalm
My prayer is prepared -- incense before Thee
Set
Incline not my heart to an evil thing
The righteous doth beat me `in' kindness. And doth reprove me
Their judges have been released by the sides of a rock
As one tilling and ripping up in the land
But to Thee
Keep me from the gin they laid for me
The wicked fall in their nets together
