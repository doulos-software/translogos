A Psalm of Asaph. The God of gods -- Jehovah -- hath spoken
From Zion
Our God cometh
He doth call unto the heavens from above
Gather ye to Me My saints
And the heavens declare His righteousness
Hear
Not for thy sacrifices do I reprove thee
I take not from thy house a bullock
For Mine `is' every beast of the forest
I have known every fowl of the mountains
If I am hungry I tell not to thee
Do I eat the flesh of bulls
Sacrifice to God confession
And call Me in a day of adversity
And to the wicked hath God said: What to thee -- to recount My statutes? That thou liftest up My covenant on thy mouth?"
Yea
If thou hast seen a thief
Thy mouth thou hast sent forth with evil
Thou sittest
These thou didst
Understand this
He who is sacrificing praise honoureth Me
