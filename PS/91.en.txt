He who is dwelling In the secret place of the Most High
He is saying of Jehovah
For He delivereth thee from the snare of a fowler
With His pinion He covereth thee over
Thou art not afraid of fear by night
Of pestilence in thick darkness that walketh
There fall at thy side a thousand
But with thine eyes thou lookest
(For Thou
Evil happeneth not unto thee
For His messengers He chargeth for thee
On the hands they bear thee up
On lion and asp thou treadest
Because in Me he hath delighted
He doth call Me
With length of days I satisfy him
