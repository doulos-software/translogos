To the Overseer. -- By David. In Jehovah I trusted
For lo
When the foundations are destroyed
`Jehovah `is' in his holy temple: Jehovah -- in the heavens `is' His throne. His eyes see -- His eyelids try the sons of men."
Jehovah the righteous doth try. And the wicked and the lover of violence
He poureth on the wicked snares
For righteous `is' Jehovah
