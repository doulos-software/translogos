To the Overseer. -- `On the Dumb Dove far off.' -- A secret treasure of David
Mine enemies have swallowed up all the day
The day I am afraid I am confident toward Thee."
In God I praise His word
All the day they wrest my words
They assemble
By iniquity they escape
My wandering Thou hast counted
Then turn back do mine enemies in the day I call. This I have known
In God I praise the word
In God I trusted
On me
For Thou hast delivered my soul from death
