By David. Unto Thee
My God
Also let none waiting on Thee be ashamed
Thy ways
Cause me to tread in Thy truth
Remember Thy mercies
Sins of my youth
Good and upright `is' Jehovah
He causeth the humble to tread in judgment
All the paths of Jehovah `are' kindness and truth
For Thy name's sake
Who `is' this -- the man fearing Jehovah? He directeth him in the way He doth choose."
His soul in good doth remain
The secret of Jehovah `is' for those fearing Him
Mine eyes `are' continually unto Jehovah
Turn Thou unto me
The distresses of my heart have enlarged themselves
See mine affliction and my misery
See my enemies
Keep my soul
Integrity and uprightness do keep me
Redeem Israel
