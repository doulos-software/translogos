A Song
Beautiful `for' elevation
God in her high places is known for a tower."
For
They have seen -- so they have marvelled
Trembling hath seized them there
By an east wind Thou shiverest ships of Tarshish."
As we have heard
We have thought
As `is' Thy name
Rejoice doth Mount Zion
Compass Zion
Set your heart to her bulwark
That this God `is' our God -- To the age and for ever
