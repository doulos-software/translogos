By David. Jehovah `is' my light and my salvation
When evil doers come near to me to eat my flesh
Though a host doth encamp against me
One `thing' I asked of Jehovah -- it I seek. My dwelling in the house of Jehovah
For He hideth me in a tabernacle in the day of evil
And now
Hear
To Thee said my heart `They sought my face
Hide not Thy face from me
When my father and my mother Have forsaken me
Shew me
Give me not to the will of my adversaries
I had not believed to look on the goodness of Jehovah In the land of the living!"
Look unto Jehovah -- be strong
