Give ye thanks to Jehovah -- call ye in His name
Sing ye to Him -- sing praise to Him
Boast yourselves in His Holy Name
Seek ye Jehovah and His strength
Remember His wonders that He did
O seed of Abraham
He `is' Jehovah our God
He hath remembered to the age His covenant
That He hath made with Abraham
And doth establish it to Jacob for a statute
Saying
In their being few in number
And they go up and down
He hath not suffered any to oppress them And He reproveth for their sakes kings."
`Strike not against Mine anointed
And He calleth a famine on the land
He hath sent before them a man
They have afflicted with fetters his feet
Till the time of the coming of His word The saying of Jehovah hath tried him."
The king hath sent
He hath made him lord of his house
To bind his chiefs at his pleasure
And Israel cometh in to Egypt
And He maketh His people very fruitful
He turned their heart to hate His people
He hath sent Moses His servant
They have set among them the matters of His signs
He hath sent darkness
He hath turned their waters to blood
Teemed hath their land `with' frogs
He hath said
He hath made their showers hail
And He smiteth their vine and their fig
He hath said
And it consumeth every herb in their land
And He smiteth every first-born in their land
And bringeth them out with silver and gold
Rejoiced hath Egypt in their going forth
He hath spread a cloud for a covering
They have asked
He hath opened a rock
For He hath remembered His holy word
And He bringeth forth His people with joy
And He giveth to them the lands of nations
That they may observe His statutes
