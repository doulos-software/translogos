By David. Strive
Take hold of shield and buckler
And draw out spear and lance
They are ashamed and blush
They are as chaff before wind
Their way is darkness and slipperiness
For without cause they hid for me their netpit
Meet him doth desolation -- he knoweth not
And my soul is joyful in Jehovah
All my bones say
Violent witnesses rise up
They pay me evil for good
And I -- in their sickness my clothing `is' sackcloth
As `if' a friend
And -- in my halting they have rejoiced
With profane ones
Lord
I thank Thee in a great assembly
Mine enemies rejoice not over me `with' falsehood
For they speak not peace
And they enlarge against me their mouth
Thou hast seen
Stir up
Judge me according to Thy righteousness
They do not say in their heart
They are ashamed and confounded together
They sing and rejoice
And my tongue uttereth Thy righteousness
