A Prayer of David. Incline
Keep my soul
Favour me
Rejoice the soul of Thy servant
For Thou
Hear
In a day of my distress I call Thee
There is none like Thee among the gods
All nations that Thou hast made Come and bow themselves before Thee
For great `art' Thou
Show me
I confess Thee
For Thy kindness `is' great toward me
O God
And Thou
Look unto me
Do with me a sign for good
