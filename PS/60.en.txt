To the Overseer. -- `Concerning the Lily of Testimony
Thou hast caused the land to tremble
Thou hast shewn Thy people a hard thing
Thou hast given to those fearing thee an ensign. To be lifted up as an ensign Because of truth. Selah."
That Thy beloved ones may be drawn out
God hath spoken in His holiness: I exult -- I apportion Shechem
Mine `is' Gilead
Moab `is' my pot for washing
Who doth bring me `to' a city of bulwarks? Who hath led me unto Edom?"
Is it not Thou
Give to us help from adversity
In God we do mightily
