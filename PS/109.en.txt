To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. O God of my praise
For the mouth of wickedness
They have compassed me about
For my love they oppose me
And they set against me evil for good
Appoint Thou over him the wicked
In his being judged
His days are few
His sons are fatherless
And wander continually do his sons
An exactor layeth a snare for all that he hath
He hath none to extend kindness
His posterity is for cutting off
The iniquity of his fathers Is remembered unto Jehovah
They are before Jehovah continually
Because that he hath not remembered to do kindness
And he loveth reviling
And he putteth on reviling as his robe
It is to him as apparel -- he covereth himself
This `is' the wage of mine accusers from Jehovah
And Thou
For I `am' poor and needy
As a shadow when it is stretched out I have gone
My knees have been feeble from fasting
And I -- I have been a reproach to them
Help me
And they know that this `is' Thy hand
They revile
Mine accusers put on blushing
I thank Jehovah greatly with my mouth
For He standeth at the right hand of the needy
