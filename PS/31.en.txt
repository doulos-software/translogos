To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. In Thee
Incline unto me Thine ear hastily
For my rock and my bulwark `art' Thou
Bring me out from the net that they hid for me
Into Thy hand I commit my spirit
I have hated the observers of lying vanities
I rejoice
And Thou hast not shut me up
Favour me
For my life hath been consumed in sorrow And my years in sighing. Feeble because of mine iniquity hath been my strength
Among all mine adversaries I have been a reproach
I have been forgotten as dead out of mind
For I have heard an evil account of many
And I on Thee -- I have trusted
In Thy hand `are' my times
Cause Thy face to shine on Thy servant
O Jehovah
Let lips of falsehood become dumb
How abundant is Thy goodness
Thou hast wrought for those trusting in Thee
Blessed `is' Jehovah
And I -- I have said in my haste
Love Jehovah
Be strong
