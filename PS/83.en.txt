A Song
For
Against Thy people they take crafty counsel
They have said
For they consulted in heart together
Tents of Edom
Gebal
Asshur also is joined with them
Do to them as `to' Midian
They were destroyed at Endor
Make their nobles as Oreb and as Zeeb
Who have said
O my God
As a fire doth burn a forest
So dost Thou pursue them with Thy whirlwind
Fill their faces `with' shame
They are ashamed and troubled for ever
And they know that Thou -- (Thy name `is' Jehovah -- by Thyself
