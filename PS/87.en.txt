By sons of Korah. -- A Psalm
Jehovah is loving the gates of Zion Above all the tabernacles of Jacob."
Honourable things are spoken in Thee
I mention Rahab and Babel to those knowing Me
And of Zion it is said: Each one was born in her
Jehovah doth recount in the describing of the peoples
Singers also as players on instruments
