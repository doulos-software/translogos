Praise ye Jah! Praise ye the name of Jehovah
Who are standing in the house of Jehovah
Praise ye Jah! for Jehovah `is' good
For Jacob hath Jah chosen for Himself
For I have known that great `is' Jehovah
All that Jehovah pleased He hath done
Causing vapours to ascend from the end of the earth
Who smote the first-born of Egypt
He sent tokens and wonders into thy midst
Who smote many nations
Even Sihon king of the Amorite
And He gave their land an inheritance
O Jehovah
For Jehovah doth judge His people
The idols of the nations `are' silver and gold
A mouth they have
Ears they have
Like them are their makers
O house of Israel
O house of Levi
Blessed `is' Jehovah from Zion
