To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. A Psalm. Thou hast accepted
Thou hast borne away the iniquity of Thy people
Thou hast gathered up all Thy wrath
Turn back `to' us
To the age art Thou angry against us? Dost Thou draw out Thine anger To generation and generation?"
Dost Thou not turn back? Thou revivest us
Show us
I hear what God Jehovah speaketh
Only
Kindness and truth have met
Truth from the earth springeth up
Jehovah also giveth that which is good
Righteousness before Him goeth
