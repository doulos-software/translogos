To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David
Thoroughly wash me from mine iniquity
For my transgressions I do know
Against Thee
Lo
Lo
Thou cleansest me with hyssop and I am clean
Thou causest me to hear joy and gladness
Hide Thy face from my sin. And all mine iniquities blot out."
A clean heart prepare for me
Cast me not forth from Thy presence
Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation
I teach transgressors Thy ways
Deliver me from blood
O Lord
For Thou desirest not sacrifice
The sacrifices of God `are' a broken spirit
Do good in Thy good pleasure with Zion
Then Thou desirest sacrifices of righteousness
