To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. I have diligently expected Jehovah
And He doth cause me to come up From a pit of desolation -- from mire of mud
And He putteth in my mouth a new song
O the happiness of the man Who hath made Jehovah his trust
Much hast Thou done
Sacrifice and present Thou hast not desired
Then said I
To do Thy pleasure
I have proclaimed tidings of righteousness In the great assembly
Thy righteousness I have not concealed In the midst of my heart
Thou
For compassed me have evils innumerable
Be pleased
They are ashamed and confounded together
They are desolate because of their shame
All seeking Thee rejoice and are glad in Thee
And I `am' poor and needy
