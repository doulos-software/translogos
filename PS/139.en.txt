To the Overseer. -- A Psalm by David. Jehovah
Thou -- Thou hast known my sitting down
My path and my couch Thou hast fanned
For there is not a word in my tongue
Behind and before Thou hast besieged me
Knowledge too wonderful for me
Whither do I go from Thy Spirit? And whither from Thy face do I flee?"
If I ascend the heavens -- there Thou `art'
I take the wings of morning
Also there Thy hand doth lead me
And I say
Also darkness hideth not from Thee
For Thou -- Thou hast possessed my reins
I confess Thee
My substance was not hid from Thee
Mine unformed substance Thine eyes saw
And to me how precious have been Thy thoughts
I recount them! than the sand they are more
Dost Thou slay
Who exchange Thee for wickedness
Do not I hate
`With' perfect hatred I have hated them
Search me
And see if a grievous way be in me
