To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. Jehovah
The desire of his heart Thou gavest to him
For Thou puttest before him blessings of goodness
Life he hath asked from Thee
Great `is' his honour in Thy salvation
For Thou makest him blessings for ever
For the king is trusting in Jehovah
Thy hand cometh to all Thine enemies
Thou makest them as a furnace of fire
Their fruit from earth Thou destroyest
For they stretched out against Thee evil
For Thou makest them a butt
Be Thou exalted
