By David. -- An Instruction. O the happiness of him whose transgression `is' forgiven
O the happiness of a man
When I have kept silence
When by day and by night Thy hand is heavy upon me
My sin I cause Thee to know
For this doth every saintly one pray to Thee
Thou `art' a hiding-place for me
I cause thee to act wisely
Be ye not as a horse -- as a mule
Many `are' the pains of the wicked; As to him who is trusting in Jehovah
Be glad in Jehovah
