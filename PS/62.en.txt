To the Overseer
Only -- He `is' my rock
Till when do ye devise mischief against a man? Ye are destroyed all of you
Only -- from his excellency They have consulted to drive away
Only -- for God
Only -- He `is' my rock and my salvation
On God `is' my salvation
Trust in Him at all times
Only -- vanity `are' the low
Trust not in oppression
Once hath God spoken
And with Thee
