To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. Hear
Hidest me from the secret counsel of evil doers
Who sharpened as a sword their tongue
To shoot in secret places the perfect
They strengthen for themselves an evil thing
They search out perverse things
And God doth shoot them `with' an arrow
And they cause him to stumble
And all men fear
The righteous doth rejoice in Jehovah
