An Instruction of Asaph. Give ear
I open with a simile my mouth
That we have heard and do know
We do not hide from their sons
And He raiseth up a testimony in Jacob
So that a later generation doth know
And place in God their confidence
And they are not like their fathers
Sons of Ephraim -- armed bearers of bow
They have not kept the covenant of God
And they forget His doings
Before their fathers He hath done wonders
He cleft a sea
And leadeth them with a cloud by day
He cleaveth rocks in a wilderness
And bringeth out streams from a rock
And they add still to sin against Him
And they try God in their heart
And they speak against God -- they said: `Is God able to array a table in a wilderness?'"
Lo
Therefore hath Jehovah heard
For they have not believed in God
And He commandeth clouds from above
And He raineth on them manna to eat
Food of the mighty hath each eaten
He causeth an east wind to journey in the heavens
And He raineth on them flesh as dust
And causeth `it' to fall in the midst of His camp
And they eat
They have not been estranged from their desire
And the anger of God hath gone up against them
With all this they have sinned again
And He consumeth in vanity their days
If He slew them
And they remember that God `is' their rock
And -- they deceive Him with their mouth
And their heart hath not been right with Him
And He -- the Merciful One
And He remembereth that they `are' flesh
How often do they provoke Him in the wilderness
Yea
They have not remembered His hand The day He ransomed them from the adversary."
When He set His signs in Egypt
And He turneth to blood their streams
He sendeth among them the beetle
And giveth to the caterpillar their increase
He destroyeth with hail their vine
And delivereth up to the hail their beasts
He sendeth on them the fury of His anger
He pondereth a path for His anger
And He smiteth every first-born in Egypt
And causeth His people to journey as a flock
And He leadeth them confidently
And He bringeth them in unto the border of His sanctuary
And casteth out nations from before them
And they tempt and provoke God Most High
And they turn back
And make Him angry with their high places
God hath heard
And He leaveth the tabernacle of Shiloh
And He giveth His strength to captivity
And delivereth up to the sword His people
His young men hath fire consumed
His priests by the sword have fallen
And the Lord waketh as a sleeper
And He smiteth His adversaries backward
And He kicketh against the tent of Joseph
And He chooseth the tribe of Judah
And buildeth His sanctuary as a high place
And He fixeth on David His servant
From behind suckling ones He hath brought him in
And he ruleth them according to the integrity of his heart
