Praise ye Jah! For `it is' good to praise our God
Building Jerusalem `is' Jehovah
Who is giving healing to the broken of heart
Appointing the number of the stars
Great `is' our Lord
Jehovah is causing the meek to stand
Answer ye to Jehovah with thanksgiving
Who is covering the heavens with clouds
Giving to the beast its food
Not in the might of the horse doth He delight
Jehovah is pleased with those fearing Him
Glorify
For He did strengthen the bars of thy gates
Who is making thy border peace
Who is sending forth His saying `on' earth
Who is giving snow like wool
Casting forth His ice like morsels
He sendeth forth His word and melteth them
Declaring His words to Jacob
He hath not done so to any nation
