Praise ye Jah! Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens
Praise ye Him
Praise ye Him
Praise ye Him
They do praise the name of Jehovah
And He establisheth them for ever to the age
Praise ye Jehovah from the earth
Fire and hail
The mountains and all heights
The wild beast
Kings of earth
Young men
They praise the name of Jehovah
And He exalteth the horn of His people
