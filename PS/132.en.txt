A Song of the Ascents. Remember
Who hath sworn to Jehovah. He hath vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:"
`If I enter into the tent of my house
If I give sleep to mine eyes
Till I do find a place for Jehovah
`Lo
We come in to His tabernacles
Arise
Thy priests do put on righteousness
For the sake of David Thy servant
Jehovah hath sworn truth to David
If thy sons keep My covenant
For Jehovah hath fixed on Zion
This `is' My rest for ever and ever
Her provision I greatly bless
And her priests I clothe `with' salvation
There I cause to spring up a horn for David
His enemies I do clothe `with' shame
