To the Overseer. -- A Psalm
As the driving away of smoke Thou drivest away
And the righteous rejoice
Sing ye to God -- praise His name
Father of the fatherless
God -- causing the lonely to dwell at home
O God
The earth hath shaken
A shower of free-will gifts thou shakest out
Thy company have dwelt in it
The Lord doth give the saying
Kings of hosts flee utterly away
Though ye do lie between two boundaries
When the Mighty spreadeth kings in it
A hill of God `is' the hill of Bashan
Why do ye envy
The chariots of God `are' myriads
Thou hast ascended on high
Blessed `is' the Lord
God Himself `is' to us a God for deliverances
Only -- God doth smite The head of His enemies
The Lord said: `From Bashan I bring back
So that thou dashest thy foot in blood
They have seen Thy goings
Singers have been before
In assemblies bless ye God
There `is' little Benjamin their ruler
Thy God hath commanded thy strength
Because of Thy temple at Jerusalem
Rebuke a beast of the reeds
Come do fat ones out of Egypt
Kingdoms of the earth
To him who is riding on the heavens of the heavens of old
Ascribe ye strength to God
Fearful
