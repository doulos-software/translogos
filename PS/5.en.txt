To the Overseer
Be attentive to the voice of my cry
Jehovah
For not a God desiring wickedness `art' Thou
The boastful station not themselves before Thine eyes: Thou hast hated all working iniquity."
Thou destroyest those speaking lies
And I
O Jehovah
For there is no stability in their mouth. Their heart `is' mischiefs
Declare them guilty
And rejoice do all trusting in Thee
For Thou blessest the righteous
