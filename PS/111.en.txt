Praise ye Jah! I thank Jehovah with the whole heart
Great `are' the works of Jehovah
Honourable and majestic is His work
A memorial He hath made of His wonders
Prey He hath given to those fearing Him
The power of His works He hath declared to His people
The works of His hands `are' true and just
They are sustained for ever to the age. They are made in truth and uprightness."
Redemption He hath sent to His people
The beginning of wisdom `is' fear of Jehovah
