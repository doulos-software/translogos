|mtmoor las'ph| _elh'm_ has taken his place in the divine council; in the midst of _elh'm_ he holds judgment:
"How long will you _tshphtu-avl_ and show partiality to the wicked? Selah
Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute.
Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked."
They have neither knowledge nor understanding, they walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
I said of you, "_elh'm_, _vbn'_ _el'un_, all of you;
nevertheless, like men you shall die, and fall like any prince."
Arise, _elh'm_, judge the earth; for you shall inherit all the nations!
