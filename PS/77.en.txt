To the Overseer
In a day of my distress the Lord I sought
I remember God
Thou hast taken hold of the watches of mine eyes
I have reckoned the days of old
I remember my music in the night
To the ages doth the Lord cast off? Doth He add to be pleased no more?"
Hath His kindness ceased for ever? The saying failed to all generations?"
Hath God forgotten `His' favours? Hath He shut up in anger His mercies? Selah."
And I say: `My weakness is
I mention the doings of Jah
And I have meditated on all Thy working
O God
Thou `art' the God doing wonders. Thou hast made known among the peoples Thy strength
Thou hast redeemed with strength Thy people
The waters have seen Thee
Poured out waters have thick clouds
The voice of Thy thunder `is' in the spheres
In the sea `is' Thy way
Thou hast led as a flock Thy people
