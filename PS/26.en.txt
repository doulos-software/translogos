By David. Judge me
Try me
For Thy kindness `is' before mine eyes
I have not sat with vain men
I have hated the assembly of evil doers
I wash in innocency my hands
To sound with a voice of confession
Jehovah
Do not gather with sinners my soul
In whose hand `is' a wicked device
And I
My foot hath stood in uprightness
