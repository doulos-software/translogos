A Prayer of Moses
Before mountains were brought forth
Thou turnest man unto a bruised thing
For a thousand years in Thine eyes `are' as yesterday
Thou hast inundated them
In the morning it flourisheth
For we were consumed in Thine anger
Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee
For all our days pined away in Thy wrath
Days of our years
Who knoweth the power of Thine anger? And according to Thy fear -- Thy wrath?"
To number our days aright let `us' know
Turn back
Satisfy us at morn `with' Thy kindness
Cause us to rejoice according to the days Wherein Thou hast afflicted us
Let Thy work appear unto Thy servants
And let the pleasantness of Jehovah our God be upon us
