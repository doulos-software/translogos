To the Overseer. -- A Song
Praise ye the honour of His name
Say to God
All the earth do bow to Thee
Come ye
He hath turned a sea to dry land
Ruling by His might to the age
Bless
Who hath placed our soul in life
For Thou hast tried us
Thou hast brought us into a net
Thou hast caused man to ride at our head. We have entered into fire and into water
I enter Thy house with burnt-offerings
For opened were my lips
`Burnt-offerings of fatlings I offer to Thee
Come
Unto Him `with' my mouth I have called
Iniquity
But God hath heard
Blessed `is' God
