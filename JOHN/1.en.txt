In the beginning was the Word
this one was in the beginning with God;"
all things through him did happen
In him was life
and the light in the darkness did shine
There came a man -- having been sent from God -- whose name `is' John
this one came for testimony
that one was not the Light
He was the true Light
in the world he was
to his own things he came
but as many as did receive him to them he gave authority to become sons of God -- to those believing in his name
who -- not of blood nor of a will of flesh
And the Word became flesh
John doth testify concerning him
and out of his fulness did we all receive
for the law through Moses was given
God no one hath ever seen; the only begotten Son
And this is the testimony of John
and he confessed and did not deny
And they questioned him
They said then to him
He said
And those sent were of the Pharisees
and they questioned him and said to him
John answered them
of whom I am not worthy that I may loose the cord of his sandal.'"
These things came to pass in Bethabara
on the morrow John seeth Jesus coming unto him
this is he concerning whom I said
and I knew him not
And John testified
and I did not know him
and I have seen
On the morrow
and having looked on Jesus walking
and the two disciples heard him speaking
And Jesus having turned
He saith to them
Andrew
this one doth first find his own brother Simon
and he brought him unto Jesus: and having looked upon him
On the morrow
And Philip was from Bethsaida
Philip findeth Nathanael
and Nathanael said to him
Jesus saw Nathanael coming unto him
Nathanael saith to him
Nathanael answered and saith to him
Jesus answered and said to him
and he saith to him
