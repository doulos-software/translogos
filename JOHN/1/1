That which was from the beginning
and the Life was manifested
that which we have seen and heard declare we to you
and these things we write to you
And this is the message that we have heard from Him
if we may say -- `we have fellowship with Him
and if in the light we may walk
if we may say -- `we have not sin
if we may confess our sins
if we may say -- `we have not sinned
