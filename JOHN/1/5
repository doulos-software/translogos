Every one who is believing that Jesus is the Christ
in this we know that we love the children of God
for this is the love of God
because every one who is begotten of God doth overcome the world
who is he who is overcoming the world
This one is he who did come through water and blood -- Jesus the Christ
because three are who are testifying `in the heaven
and three are who are testifying in the earth'
If the testimony of men we receive
He who is believing in the Son of God
and this is the testimony
he who is having the Son
These things I did write to you who are believing in the name of the Son of God
And this is the boldness that we have toward Him
and if we have known that He doth hear us
If any one may see his brother sinning a sin not unto death
all unrighteousness is sin
We have known that every one who hath been begotten of God doth not sin
we have known that of God we are
and we have known that the Son of God is come
Little children
