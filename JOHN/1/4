Beloved
in this know ye the Spirit of God; every spirit that doth confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come
and every spirit that doth not confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come
Ye -- of God ye are
They -- of the world they are; because of this from the world they speak
we -- of God we are; he who is knowing God doth hear us; he who is not of God
Beloved
he who is not loving did not know God
In this was manifested the love of God in us
in this is the love
Beloved
God no one hath ever seen; if we may love one another
in this we know that in Him we do remain
And we -- we have seen and do testify
whoever may confess that Jesus is the Son of God
and we -- we have known and believed the love
In this made perfect hath been the love with us
fear is not in the love
we -- we love him
if any one may say -- `I love God
and this `is' the command we have from Him
