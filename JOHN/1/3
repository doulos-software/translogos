See ye what love the Father hath given to us
beloved
and every one who is having this hope on him
Every one who is doing the sin
and ye have known that he was manifested that our sins he may take away
every one who is remaining in him doth not sin; every one who is sinning
Little children
he who is doing the sin
every one who hath been begotten of God
In this manifest are the children of God
because this is the message that ye did hear from the beginning
not as Cain -- of the evil one he was
Do not wonder
we -- we have known that we have passed out of the death to the life
Every one who is hating his brother -- a man-killer he is
in this we have known the love
and whoever may have the goods of the world
My little children
and in this we know that of the truth we are
because if our heart may condemn -- because greater is God than our heart
Beloved
and whatever we may ask
and this is His command
and he who is keeping His commands
