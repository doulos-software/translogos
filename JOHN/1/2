My little children
and he -- he is a propitiation for our sins
and in this we know that we have known him
he who is saying
and whoever may keep his word
He who is saying in him he doth remain
Brethren
again
he who is saying
he who is loving his brother
and he who is hating his brother
I write to you
I write to you
I did write to you
Love not ye the world
because all that `is' in the world -- the desire of the flesh
and the world doth pass away
Little youths
out of us they went forth
And ye have an anointing from the Holy One
I did not write to you because ye have not known the truth
Who is the liar
every one who is denying the Son
Ye
and this is the promise that He did promise us -- the life the age-during."
These things I did write to you concerning those leading you astray;"
and you
And now
if ye know that he is righteous
