And Jesus was walking after these things in Galilee
and the feast of the Jews was nigh -- that of tabernacles --"
his brethren
for no one in secret doth anything
for not even were his brethren believing in him."
Jesus
the world is not able to hate you
Ye -- go ye up to this feast; I do not yet go up to this feast
and saying these things to them
And when his brethren went up
the Jews
and there was much murmuring about him among the multitudes
no one
And it being now the middle of the feast
and the Jews were wondering
Jesus answered them and said
if any one may will to do His will
`He who is speaking from himself his own glory doth seek
hath not Moses given you the law? and none of you doth the law; why me do ye seek to kill?'"
The multitude answered and said
Jesus answered and said to them
because of this
if a man doth receive circumcision on a sabbath that the law of Moses may not be broken
judge not according to appearance
Certain
and
but this one -- we have known whence he is; and the Christ
Jesus cried
and I have known Him
They were seeking
and many out of the multitude did believe in him
The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him
Jesus
ye will seek me
The Jews
what is this word that he said
And in the last
he who is believing in me
and this he said of the Spirit
Many
others said
Did not the Writing say
A division
And certain of them were willing to seize him
the officers came
The officers answered
The Pharisees
did any one out of the rulers believe in him? or out of the Pharisees?"
but this multitude
Nicodemus saith unto them -- he who came by night unto him -- being one of them
`Doth our law judge the man
They answered and said to him
and each one went on to his house
