After these things Jesus went away beyond the sea of Galilee (of Tiberias)
and there was following him a great multitude
and Jesus went up to the mount
and the passover was nigh
Jesus then having lifted up `his' eyes and having seen that a great multitude doth come to him
and this he said
Philip answered him
one of his disciples -- Andrew
`There is one little lad here who hath five barley loaves
And Jesus said
and Jesus took the loaves
And when they were filled
they gathered together
The men
Jesus
And when evening came
and having entered into the boat
the sea also -- a great wind blowing -- was being raised
having pushed onwards
and he saith to them
they were willing then to receive him into the boat
On the morrow
(and other little boats came from Tiberias
when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus is not there
and having found him on the other side of the sea
Jesus answered them and said
work not for the food that is perishing
They said therefore unto him
Jesus answered and said to them
They said therefore to him
our fathers the manna did eat in the wilderness
Jesus
for the bread of God is that which is coming down out of the heaven
They said
And Jesus said to them
but I said to you
all that the Father doth give to me will come unto me; and him who is coming unto me
because I have come down out of the heaven
`And this is the will of the Father who sent me
and this is the will of Him who sent me
The Jews
and they said
Jesus answered
no one is able to come unto me
it is having been written in the prophets
not that any one hath seen the Father
`Verily
I am the bread of the life;"
your fathers did eat the manna in the wilderness
this is the bread that out of the heaven is coming down
`I am the living bread that came down out of the heaven; if any one may eat of this bread he shall live -- to the age; and the bread also that I will give is my flesh
The Jews
Jesus
he who is eating my flesh
for my flesh truly is food
he who is eating my flesh
`According as the living Father sent me
this is the bread that came down out of the heaven; not as your fathers did eat the manna
These things he said in a synagogue
many
And Jesus having known in himself that his disciples are murmuring about this
if then ye may behold the Son of Man going up where he was before?"
the spirit it is that is giving life; the flesh doth not profit anything; the sayings that I speak to you are spirit
but there are certain of you who do not believe;' for Jesus had known from the beginning who they are who are not believing
and he said
From this `time' many of his disciples went away backward
Jesus
Simon Peter
and we have believed
Jesus answered them
And he spake of Judas
