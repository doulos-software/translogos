`I am the true vine
every branch in me not bearing fruit
already ye are clean
remain in me
`I am the vine
if any one may not remain in me
if ye may remain in me
`In this was my Father glorified
According as the Father did love me
if my commandments ye may keep
these things I have spoken to you
`This is my command
greater love than this hath no one
ye are my friends
no more do I call you servants
`Ye did not choose out me
`These things I command you
if the world doth hate you
if of the world ye were
`Remember the word that I said to you
but all these things will they do to you
if I had not come and spoken to them
`He who is hating me
if I did not do among them the works that no other hath done
but -- that the word may be fulfilled that was written in their law -- They hated me without a cause."
`And when the Comforter may come
and ye also do testify
