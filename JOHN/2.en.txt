And the third day a marriage happened in Cana of Galilee
and also Jesus was called
and wine having failed
Jesus saith to her
His mother saith to the ministrants
And there were there six water-jugs of stone
Jesus saith to them
and he saith to them
And as the director of the apartment tasted the water become wine
and saith to him
This beginning of the signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee
after this he went down to Capernaum
And the passover of the Jews was nigh
and he found in the temple those selling oxen
and having made a whip of small cords
and to those selling the doves he said
And his disciples remembered that it is written
the Jews then answered and said to him
Jesus answered and said to them
The Jews
but he spake concerning the sanctuary of his body;"
when
And as he was in Jerusalem
and Jesus himself was not trusting himself to them
and because he had no need that any should testify concerning man
