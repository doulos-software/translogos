`Let not your heart be troubled
in the house of my Father are many mansions; and if not
and if I go on and prepare for you a place
and whither I go away ye have known
Thomas saith to him
Jesus saith to him
if ye had known me
Philip saith to him
Jesus saith to him
Believest thou not that I `am' in the Father
believe me
`Verily
and whatever ye may ask in my name
if ye ask anything in my name I will do `it'."
`If ye love me
and I will ask the Father
the Spirit of truth
`I will not leave you bereaved
yet a little
in that day ye shall know that I `am' in my Father
he who is having my commands
Judas saith to him
Jesus answered and said to him
he who is not loving me
`These things I have spoken to you
and the Comforter
`Peace I leave to you; my peace I give to you
ye heard that I said to you -- I go away
`And now I have said `it' to you before it come to pass
I will no more talk much with you
but that the world may know that I love the Father
