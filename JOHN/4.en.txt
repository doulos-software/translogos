When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus more disciples doth make and baptize than John
(though indeed Jesus himself was not baptizing
he left Judea and went away again to Galilee
and it was behoving him to go through Samaria."
He cometh
and there was there a well of Jacob. Jesus therefore having been weary from the journeying
there cometh a woman out of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith to her
for his disciples were gone away to the city
the Samaritan woman therefore saith to him
Jesus answered and said to her
The woman saith to him
Art thou greater than our father Jacob
Jesus answered and said to her
but whoever may drink of the water that I will give him
The woman saith unto him
Jesus saith to her
the woman answered and said
for five husbands thou hast had
The woman saith to him
our fathers in this mountain did worship
Jesus saith to her
ye worship what ye have not known; we worship what we have known
but
God `is' a Spirit
The woman saith to him
Jesus saith to her
And upon this came his disciples
The woman then left her water-jug
`Come
They went forth therefore out of the city
And in the meanwhile his disciples were asking him
and he said to them
The disciples then said one to another
Jesus saith to them
do not say that it is yet four months
`And he who is reaping doth receive a reward
for in this the saying is the true one
I sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured; others laboured
And from that city many believed in him
When
and many more did believe because of his word
and said to the woman -- `No more because of thy speaking do we believe; for we ourselves have heard and known that this is truly the Saviour of the world -- the Christ.'"
And after the two days he went forth thence
for Jesus himself testified that a prophet in his own country shall not have honour;"
when then
Jesus came
he
Jesus then said unto him
The courtier saith unto him
Jesus saith to him
and he now going down
he inquired then of them the hour in which he became better
then the father knew that `it was' in that hour in which Jesus said to him -- `Thy son doth live
this again a second sign did Jesus
