These things spake Jesus
according as Thou didst give to him authority over all flesh
and this is the life age-during
I did glorify Thee on the earth
`And now
I did manifest Thy name to the men whom Thou hast given to me out of the world; Thine they were
now they have known that all things
because the sayings that Thou hast given to me
`I ask in regard to them; not in regard to the world do I ask
and all mine are Thine
and no more am I in the world
when I was with them in the world
`And now unto Thee I come
I have given to them Thy word
I do not ask that Thou mayest take them out of the world
`Of the world they are not
sanctify them in Thy truth
as Thou didst send me to the world
and for them do I sanctify myself
`And not in regard to these alone do I ask
that they all may be one
`And I
I in them
`Father
`Righteous Father
and I made known to them Thy name
