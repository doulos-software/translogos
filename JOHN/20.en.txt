And on the first of the sabbaths
she runneth
Peter
and the two were running together
and having stooped down
Simon Peter
and the napkin that was upon his head
then
for not yet did they know the Writing
The disciples therefore went away again unto their own friends
and Mary was standing near the tomb
one at the head
And they say to her
and these things having said
Jesus saith to her
Jesus saith to her
Jesus saith to her
Mary the Magdalene cometh
It being
and this having said
Jesus
and this having said
if of any ye may loose the sins
And Thomas
the other disciples
And after eight days
then he saith to Thomas
And Thomas answered and said to him
Jesus saith to him
Many indeed
and these have been written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ
