And before the feast of the passover
And supper being come
Jesus knowing that all things the Father hath given to him -- into `his' hands
doth rise from the supper
afterward he putteth water into the basin
He cometh
Jesus answered and said to him
Peter saith to him
Simon Peter saith to him
Jesus saith to him
for he knew him who is delivering him up; because of this he said
When
ye call me
if then I did wash your feet -- the Lord and the Teacher -- ye also ought to wash one another's feet."
`For an example I gave to you
verily
if these things ye have known
not concerning you all do I speak; I have known whom I chose for myself; but that the Writing may be fulfilled: He who is eating the bread with me
`From this time I tell you
verily
These things having said
the disciples were looking
And there was one of his disciples reclining (at meat) in the bosom of Jesus
Simon Peter
and that one having leant back on the breast of Jesus
Jesus answereth
And after the morsel
and none of those reclining at meat knew for what intent he said this to him
for certain were thinking
having received
When
if God was glorified in him
`Little children
`A new commandment I give to you
in this shall all know that ye are my disciples
Simon Peter saith to him
Peter saith to him
Jesus answered him
