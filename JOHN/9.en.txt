And passing by
and his disciples asked him
Jesus answered
it behoveth me to be working the works of Him who sent me while it is day; night doth come
when I am in the world
These things saying
`Go away
the neighbours
others said -- `This is he;' and others -- `He is like to him;' he himself said
They said
he answered and said
they said
They bring him to the Pharisees who once `was' blind
and it was a sabbath when Jesus made the clay
Again
Of the Pharisees
They said to the blind man again
and he said -- `He is a prophet.' The Jews
and they asked them
His parents answered them and said
and how he now seeth
These things said his parents
because of this his parents said -- `He is of age
They called
he answered
And they said to him again
He answered them
They reviled him
we have known that God hath spoken to Moses
The man answered and said to them
and we have known that God doth not hear sinners
from the age it was not heard
if this one were not from God
They answered and said to him
Jesus heard that they cast him forth without
he answered and said
And Jesus said to him
and he said
And Jesus said
And those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things
Jesus said to them
