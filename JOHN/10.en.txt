`Verily
and he who is entering through the door is shepherd of the sheep;"
to this one the doorkeeper doth open
and when his own sheep he may put forth
and a stranger they will not follow
This similitude spake Jesus to them
Jesus said therefore again to them
all
I am the door
`The thief doth not come
`I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd his life layeth down for the sheep;"
and the hireling
and the hireling doth flee because he is an hireling
`I am the good shepherd
according as the Father doth know me
and other sheep I have that are not of this fold
`Because of this doth the Father love me
no one doth take it from me
Therefore
and many of them said
others said
And the dedication in Jerusalem came
and Jesus was walking in the temple
the Jews
Jesus answered them
but ye do not believe
according as I said to you: My sheep my voice do hear
and life age-during I give to them
my Father
I and the Father are one.'"
Therefore
Jesus answered them
The Jews answered him
Jesus answered them
if them he did call gods unto whom the word of God came
of him whom the Father did sanctify
if I do not the works of my Father
and if I do
Therefore were they seeking again to seize him
and went away again to the other side of the Jordan
and many came unto him
and many did believe in him there."
