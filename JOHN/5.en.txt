After these things there was a feast of the Jews
and there is in Jerusalem by the sheep-`gate' a pool that is called in Hebrew Bethesda
in these were lying a great multitude of the ailing
for a messenger at a set time was going down in the pool
and there was a certain man there being in ailment thirty and eight years
him Jesus having seen lying
The ailing man answered him
Jesus saith to him
and immediately the man became whole
the Jews then said to him that hath been healed
He answered them
they questioned him
But he that was healed had not known who he is
After these things
The man went away
and because of this were the Jews persecuting Jesus
And Jesus answered them
because of this
Jesus therefore responded and said to them
for the Father doth love the Son
`For
for neither doth the Father judge any one
that all may honour the Son according as they honour the Father; he who is not honouring the Son
`Verily
`Verily
for
and authority He gave him also to do judgment
`Wonder not at this
and they shall come forth; those who did the good things to a rising again of life
`I am not able of myself to do anything; according as I hear I judge
`If I testify concerning myself
another there is who is testifying concerning me
ye have sent unto John
`But I do not receive testimony from man
he was the burning and shining lamp
`But I have the testimony greater than John's
`And the Father who sent me Himself hath testified concerning me; ye have neither heard His voice at any time
and His word ye have not remaining in you
`Ye search the Writings
and ye do not will to come unto me
glory from man I do not receive
but I have known you
`I have come in the name of my Father
how are ye able -- ye -- to believe
`Do not think that I will accuse you unto the Father; there is who is accusing you
for if ye were believing Moses
but if his writings ye believe not
