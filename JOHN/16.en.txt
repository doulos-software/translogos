`These things I have spoken to you
out of the synagogues they will put you; but an hour doth come
and these things they will do to you
`But these things I have spoken to you
and now I go away to Him who sent me
but because these things I have said to you
`But I tell you the truth; it is better for you that I go away
and having come
concerning sin indeed
and concerning righteousness
and concerning judgment
`I have yet many things to say to you
and when He may come -- the Spirit of truth -- He will guide you to all the truth
He will glorify me
`All things
a little while

`The woman

and in that day ye will question me nothing; verily
till now ye did ask nothing in my name; ask
`These things in similitudes I have spoken to you
`In that day
for the Father himself doth love you
I came forth from the Father
His disciples say to him
now we have known that thou hast known all things
Jesus answered them
and now it hath come
these things I have spoken to you
