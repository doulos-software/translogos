And there was a certain one ailing
and it was Mary who did anoint the Lord with ointment
therefore sent the sisters unto him
and Jesus having heard
And Jesus was loving Martha
when
then after this
the disciples say to him
Jesus answered
and if any one may walk in the night
These things he said
therefore said his disciples
but Jesus had spoken about his death
Then
and I rejoice
therefore said Thomas
Jesus
And Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem
and many of the Jews had come unto Martha and Mary
Martha
Martha
but even now
Jesus saith to her
Martha saith to him
Jesus said to her
and every one who is living and believing in me shall not die -- to the age;"
believest thou this?' she saith to him
And these things having said
she
and Jesus had not yet come to the village
the Jews
Mary
Jesus
`Where have ye laid him?' they say to him
Jesus wept."
The Jews
and certain of them said
Jesus
Jesus saith
Jesus saith to her
They took away
and I knew that Thou always dost hear me
And these things saying
and he who died came forth
Many
but certain of them went away unto the Pharisees
the chief priests
if we may let him alone thus
and a certain one of them
nor reason that it is good for us that one man may die for the people
And this he said not of himself
and not for the nation only
From that day
Jesus
And the passover of the Jews was nigh
they were seeking
and both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command
