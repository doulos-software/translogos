And there was a man of the Pharisees
this one came unto him by night
Jesus answered and said to him
Nicodemus saith unto him
Jesus answered
that which hath been born of the flesh is flesh
`Thou mayest not wonder that I said to thee
the Spirit where he willeth doth blow
Nicodemus answered and said to him
Jesus answered and said to him
`Verily
if the earthly things I said to you
and no one hath gone up to the heaven
`And as Moses did lift up the serpent in the wilderness
that every one who is believing in him may not perish
for God did so love the world
For God did not send His Son to the world that he may judge the world
he who is believing in him is not judged
`And this is the judgment
for every one who is doing wicked things hateth the light
but he who is doing the truth doth come to the light
After these things came Jesus and his disciples to the land of Judea
and John was also baptizing in Aenon
for John was not yet cast into the prison --"
there arose then a question from the disciples of John with `some' Jews about purifying
and they came unto John
John answered and said
ye yourselves do testify to me that I said
he who is having the bride is bridegroom
`Him it behoveth to increase
he who from above is coming is above all; he who is from the earth
`And what he hath seen and heard this he doth testify
he who is receiving his testimony did seal that God is true;"
for he whom God sent
the Father doth love the Son
he who is believing in the Son
