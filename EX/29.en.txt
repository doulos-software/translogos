`And this `is' the thing which thou dost to them
and bread unleavened
and thou hast put them on one basket
`And Aaron and his sons thou dost bring near unto the opening of the tent of meeting
and thou hast taken the garments
and hast set the mitre on his head
and hast taken the anointing oil
`And his sons thou dost bring near
and hast girded them `with' a girdle (Aaron and his sons)
and hast brought near the bullock before the tent of meeting
`And thou hast slaughtered the bullock before Jehovah
and hast taken of the blood of the bullock
and thou hast taken all the fat which is covering the inwards
and the flesh of the bullock
`And the one ram thou dost take
and thou hast slaughtered the ram
and the ram thou dost cut into its pieces
and thou hast made perfume with the whole ram on the altar. It `is' a burnt-offering to Jehovah
`And thou hast taken the second ram
and thou hast slaughtered the ram
and thou hast taken of the blood which `is' on the altar
`And thou hast taken from the ram the fat
and one round cake of bread
`And thou hast set the whole on the hands of Aaron
and thou hast taken them out of their hand
`And thou hast taken the breast from the ram of the consecration which `is' for Aaron
and thou hast sanctified the breast of the wave-offering
and it hath been for Aaron and for his sons
`And the holy garments which are Aaron's
seven days doth the priest in his stead (of his sons) put them on
`And the ram of the consecration thou dost take
and Aaron hath eaten -- his sons also -- the flesh of the ram
and they have eaten those things by which there is atonement to consecrate their hand
and if there be left of the flesh of the consecration or of the bread till the morning
`And thou hast done thus to Aaron and to his sons
and a bullock
seven days thou dost make atonement for the altar
`And this `is' that which thou dost prepare on the altar; two lambs
the one lamb thou dost prepare in the morning
and a tenth `deal' of fine flour
`And the second lamb thou dost prepare between the evenings; according to the present of the morning
a continual burnt-offering for your generations
and I have met there with the sons of Israel
`And I have sanctified the tent of meeting
and I have tabernacled in the midst of the sons of Israel
and they have known that I `am' Jehovah their God
