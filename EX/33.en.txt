And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
(and I have sent before thee a messenger
unto a land flowing with milk and honey
And the people hear this sad thing
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and the sons of Israel take off their ornaments at mount Horeb."
And Moses taketh the tent
And it hath come to pass
And it hath come to pass
and all the people have seen the pillar of the cloud standing at the opening of the tent
And Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses face unto face
And Moses saith unto Jehovah
`And now
and He saith
And he saith unto Him
and in what is it known now
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And he saith
and He saith
He saith also
Jehovah also saith
and it hath come to pass
and I have turned aside My hands
