`Thou dost not lift up a vain report; thou dost not put thy hand with a wicked man to be a violent witness."
`Thou art not after many to evil
and a poor man thou dost not honour in his strife."
`When thou meetest thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray
when thou seest the ass of him who is hating thee crouching under its burden
`Thou dost not turn aside the judgment of thy needy one in his strife;"
from a false matter thou dost keep far off
`And a bribe thou dost not take; for the bribe bindeth the open-`eyed'
`And a sojourner thou dost not oppress
`And six years thou dost sow thy land
and the seventh thou dost release it
`Six days thou dost do thy work
and in all that which I have said unto you ye do take heed; and the name of other gods ye do not mention; it is not heard on thy mouth."
`Three times thou dost keep a feast to Me in a year;"
the Feast of Unleavened things thou dost keep; seven days thou dost eat unleavened things
and the Feast of Harvest
`Three times in a year do all thy males appear before the face of the Lord Jehovah."
`Thou dost not sacrifice on a fermented thing the blood of My sacrifice
the beginning of the first-fruits of thy ground thou dost bring into the house of Jehovah thy God; thou dost not boil a kid in its mother's milk."
`Lo
be watchful because of his presence
for
`For My messenger goeth before thee
`Thou dost not bow thyself to their gods
`And ye have served Jehovah your God
there is not a miscarrying and barren one in thy land; the number of thy days I fulfil:"
My terror I send before thee
`And I have sent the hornet before thee
I cast them not out from before thee in one year
little `by' little I cast them out from before thee
`And I have set thy border from the Red Sea
thou dost not make a covenant with them
they do not dwell in thy land
