`And thou dost make the tabernacle: ten curtains of twined linen
the length of the one curtain `is' eight and twenty by the cubit
five of the curtains are joining one unto another
`And thou hast made loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain
fifty loops thou dost make in the one curtain
and thou hast made fifty hooks of gold
`And thou hast made curtains of goats' `hair'
the length of the one curtain `is' thirty by the cubit
and thou hast joined the five curtains apart
`And thou hast made fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain
and thou hast made fifty hooks of brass
`And the superfluity in the curtains of the tent -- the half of the curtain which is superfluous -- hath spread over the hinder part of the tabernacle;"
and the cubit on this side
and thou hast made a covering for the tent
`And thou hast made the boards for the tabernacle
ten cubits `is' the length of the board
two handles `are' to the one board
and thou hast made the boards of the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side southward;"
and forty sockets of silver thou dost make under the twenty boards
`And for the second side of the tabernacle
and their forty sockets of silver
And for the sides of the tabernacle westward
And two boards thou dost make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides."
And they are pairs beneath
And they have been eight boards
`And thou hast made bars of shittim wood: five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle
and five bars for the boards of the second side of the tabernacle
and one hath caused the middle bar in the midst of the boards to reach from end unto end;"
and the boards thou dost overlay `with' gold
and thou hast raised up the tabernacle according to its fashion which thou hast been shewn in the mount."
`And thou hast made a vail of blue
and thou hast put it on four pillars of shittim wood
`And thou hast put the vail under the hooks
`And thou hast put the mercy-seat on the ark of the testimony
`And thou hast set the table at the outside of the vail
`And thou hast made a covering for the opening of the tent
and thou hast made for the covering five pillars of shittim `wood'
