And Bezaleel
And Moses calleth unto Bezaleel
And they take from before Moses all the heave-offering which the sons of Israel have brought in for the work of the service of the sanctuary to do it; and still they have brought in unto him a willing-offering morning by morning."
And all the wise men
and speak unto Moses
And Moses commandeth
and the work hath been sufficient for them
And all the wise-hearted ones among the doers of the work make the tabernacle; ten curtains of twined linen
The length of the one curtain `is' eight and twenty by the cubit
And he joineth the five curtains one unto another
and he maketh loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain
fifty loops he hath made in the one curtain
And he maketh fifty hooks of gold
And he maketh curtains of goats' `hair' for a tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains he hath made them;"
the length of the one curtain `is' thirty by the cubit
and he joineth the five curtains apart
And he maketh fifty loops on the outer edge of the curtain
and he maketh fifty hooks of brass to join the tent -- to be one;"
and he maketh a covering for the tent of rams' skins made red
And he maketh the boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood
ten cubits `is' the length of the `one' board
two handles `are' to the one board
And he maketh the boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward;"
and forty sockets of silver he hath made under the twenty boards
And for the second side of the tabernacle
and their forty sockets of silver
and for the sides of the tabernacle
and two boards hath he made for the corners of the tabernacle
and they have been twins below
and there have been eight boards; and their sockets of silver `are' sixteen sockets
And he maketh bars of shittim wood
and five bars for the boards of the second side of the tabernacle
and he maketh the middle bar to enter into the midst of the boards from end to end;"
and the boards he hath overlaid with gold
And he maketh the vail of blue
and he maketh for it four pillars of shittim `wood'
And he maketh a covering for the opening of the tent
also its five pillars
