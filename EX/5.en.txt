And afterwards have Moses and Aaron entered
and Pharaoh saith
And they say
And the king of Egypt saith unto them
Pharaoh also saith
And Pharaoh commandeth
`Ye do not add to give straw to the people for the making of the bricks
and the proper quantity of the bricks which they are making heretofore ye do put on them
let the service be heavy on the men
And the exactors of the people
ye -- go ye
And the people is scattered over all the land of Egypt
and the exactors are making haste
And the authorities of the sons of Israel
And the authorities of the sons of Israel come in and cry unto Pharaoh
Straw is not given to thy servants
And he saith
and now
And the authorities of the sons of Israel see them in affliction
And they meet Moses and Aaron standing to meet them
and say unto them
And Moses turneth back unto Jehovah
and since I have come unto Pharaoh
