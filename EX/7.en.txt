And Jehovah saith unto Moses
thou -- thou dost speak all that I command thee
`And I harden the heart of Pharaoh
and Pharaoh doth not hearken
and the Egyptians have known that I `am' Jehovah
And Moses doth -- Aaron also -- as Jehovah commanded them; so have they done;"
and Moses `is' a son of eighty years
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron
`When Pharaoh speaketh unto you
And Moses goeth in -- Aaron also -- unto Pharaoh
And Pharaoh also calleth for wise men
and they cast down each his rod
and the heart of Pharaoh is strong
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
go unto Pharaoh in the morning
and thou hast said unto him: Jehovah
`Thus said Jehovah: By this thou knowest that I `am' Jehovah; lo
and the fish that `are' in the River die
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And Moses and Aaron do so
and the fish which `is' in the River hath died
And the scribes of Egypt do so with their flashings
and Pharaoh turneth and goeth in unto his house
and all the Egyptians seek water round about the river to drink
And seven days are completed after Jehovah's smiting the River
