And they journey from Elim
And all the company of the sons of Israel murmur against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness;"
and the sons of Israel say unto them
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and it hath been on the sixth day
And Moses saith -- Aaron also -- unto all the sons of Israel
and morning -- and ye have seen the honour of Jehovah
And Moses saith
And Moses saith unto Aaron
and it cometh to pass
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel; speak unto them
And it cometh to pass in the evening
and the lying of the dew goeth up
And the sons of Israel see
`This `is' the thing which Jehovah hath commanded: Gather of it each according to his eating
And the sons of Israel do so
and they measure with an omer
And Moses saith unto them
and they have not hearkened unto Moses
And they gather it morning by morning
And it cometh to pass on the sixth day
And he saith unto them
And they let it rest until the morning
And Moses saith
six days ye do gather it
And it cometh to pass on the seventh day
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
see
And the people rest on the seventh day
and the house of Israel call its name Manna
And Moses saith
And Moses saith unto Aaron
as Jehovah hath given commandment unto Moses
And the sons of Israel have eaten the manna forty years
and the omer is a tenth of the ephah."
