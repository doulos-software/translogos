And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and be prepared at morning
and no man cometh up with thee
And he heweth two tables of stone like the first
And Jehovah cometh down in a cloud
and Jehovah passeth over before his face
keeping kindness for thousands
And Moses hasteth
and saith
And He saith
`Observe for thyself that which I am commanding thee to-day: lo
take heed to thyself
for their altars ye break down
for ye do not bow yourselves to another god -- for Jehovah
`Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land
and thou hast taken of their daughters to thy sons
a molten god thou dost not make to thyself."
`The feast of unleavened things thou dost keep; seven days thou dost eat unleavened things
`All opening a womb `are' Mine
and the firstling of an ass thou dost ransom with a lamb; and if thou dost not ransom
`Six days thou dost work
`And a feast of weeks thou dost observe for thyself; first-fruits of wheat-harvest; and the feast of in-gathering
`Three times in a year do all thy males appear before the Lord Jehovah
for I dispossess nations from before thee
`Thou dost not slaughter with a fermented thing the blood of My sacrifice; and the sacrifice of the feast of the passover doth not remain till morning:"
the first of the first-fruits of the land thou dost bring into the house of Jehovah thy God; thou dost not boil a kid in its mother's milk.'"
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And he is there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; bread he hath not eaten
And it cometh to pass
and Aaron seeth -- all the sons of Israel also -- Moses
And Moses calleth unto them
and afterwards have all the sons of Israel come nigh
And Moses finisheth speaking with them
and in the going in of Moses before Jehovah to speak with Him
and the sons of Israel have seen the face of Moses that the skin of the face of Moses hath shone
