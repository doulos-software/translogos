And there goeth a man of the house of Levi
and the woman conceiveth
and she hath not been able any more to hide him
and his sister stationeth herself afar off
And a daughter of Pharaoh cometh down to bathe at the River
and openeth
And his sister saith unto the daughter of Pharaoh
and the daughter of Pharaoh saith to her
and the daughter of Pharaoh saith to her
And the lad groweth
And it cometh to pass
and he turneth hither and thither
And he goeth out on the second day
and he saith
And Pharaoh heareth of this thing
And to a priest of Midian `are' seven daughters
and the shepherds come and drive them away
And they come in to Reuel their father
and they say
and he saith unto his daughters
And Moses is willing to dwell with the man
and she beareth a son
And it cometh to pass during these many days
and God heareth their groaning
and God seeth the sons of Israel
