And of the blue
And he maketh the ephod
and they expand the plates of gold
shoulder-pieces they have made for it
And the girdle of his ephod which `is' on it is of the same
And they prepare the shoham stones
and he setteth them on the shoulders of the ephod -- stones of memorial for the sons of Israel
And he maketh the breastplate
it hath been square; double they have made the breastplate
And they fill in it four rows of stones; a row of a sardius
and the second row an emerald
and the third row an opal
and the fourth row a beryl
And the stones
And they make on the breastplate wreathed chains
and they make two embroidered things of gold
and they put the two thick bands of gold on the two rings on the ends of the breastplate;"
and the two ends of the two thick bands they have put on the two embroidered things
And they make two rings of gold
and they make two rings of gold
and they bind the breastplate by its rings unto the rings of the ephod
And he maketh the upper robe of the ephod
and the opening of the upper robe `is' in its midst
and they make on the hems of the upper robe pomegranates of blue
And they make bells of pure gold
a bell and a pomegranate
And they make the coats of linen
and the mitre of linen
and the girdle of twined linen
And they make the flower of the holy crown of pure gold
and they put on it a ribbon of blue
And all the service of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting is completed; and the sons of Israel do according to all that Jehovah hath commanded Moses; so they have done."
And they bring in the tabernacle unto Moses
and the covering of rams' skins
the ark of the testimony and its staves
the table
the pure candlestick
And the golden altar
the brazen altar and the brazen grate which it hath
The hangings of the court
the coloured clothes to minister in the sanctuary
According to all that Jehovah hath commanded Moses
and Moses seeth all the work
