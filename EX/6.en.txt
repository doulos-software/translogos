And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And God speaketh unto Moses
and I appear unto Abraham
and also I have established My covenant with them
and also I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel
`Therefore say to the sons of Israel
and have taken you to Me for a people
and I have brought you in unto the land which I have lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham
And Moses speaketh so unto the sons of Israel
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Go in
and Moses speaketh before Jehovah
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
These `are' heads of the house of their fathers: Sons of Reuben first-born of Israel `are' Hanoch
And sons of Simeon `are' Jemuel
And these `are' the names of the sons of Levi
The sons of Gershon `are' Libni
And the sons of Kohath `are' Amram
And the sons of Merari `are' Mahli and Mushi: these `are' families of Levi
And Amram taketh Jochebed his aunt to himself for a wife
And sons of Izhar `are' Korah
And sons of Uzziel `are' Mishael
And Aaron taketh Elisheba daughter of Amminadab
And sons of Korah `are' Assir
And Eleazar
This `is' Aaron -- and Moses -- to whom Jehovah said
these are they who are speaking unto Pharaoh king of Egypt
And it cometh to pass in the day of Jehovah's speaking unto Moses in the land of Egypt
that Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
And Moses saith before Jehovah
