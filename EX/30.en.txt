`And thou hast made an altar `for' making perfume; `of' shittim wood thou dost make it;"
a cubit its length
`And thou hast overlaid it with pure gold
and two rings of gold thou dost make to it under its crown; on its two ribs thou dost make `them'
`And thou hast made the staves of shittim wood
and thou hast put it before the vail
`And Aaron hath made perfume on it
and in Aaron's causing the lamps to go up between the evenings
`Ye do not cause strange perfume to go up upon it
and Aaron hath made atonement on its horns
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`When thou takest up the sum of the sons of Israel for their numbers
`This they do give
every one passing over unto those numbered
the rich doth not multiply
`And thou hast taken the atonement-money from the sons of Israel
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`And thou hast made a laver of brass (and its base of brass)
and Aaron and his sons have washed at it their hands and their feet
in their going in unto the tent of meeting they wash `with' water
then they have washed their hands and their feet
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`And thou
and cassia five hundred
and thou hast made it a holy anointing oil
`And thou hast anointed with it the tent of meeting
and the table and all its vessels
and the altar of burnt-offering and all its vessels
and thou hast sanctified them
and Aaron and his sons thou dost anoint
`And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak
on flesh of man it is not poured
a man who compoundeth `any' like it
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and thou hast made it a perfume
and thou hast beaten `some' of it small
`As to the perfume which thou makest
a man who maketh `any' like it -- to be refreshed by it -- hath even been cut off from his people.'"
