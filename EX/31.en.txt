`The tent of meeting
and the table and its vessels
and the altar of the burnt-offering and all its vessels
and the coloured garments
and the anointing oil
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`And thou
and ye have kept the sabbath
`Six days is work done
and the sons of Israel have observed the sabbath; to keep the sabbath to their generations `is' a covenant age-during
between Me and the sons of Israel it `is' a sign -- to the age; for six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth
And He giveth unto Moses
