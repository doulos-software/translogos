In the third month of the going out of the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt
and they journey from Rephidim
And Moses hath gone up unto God
Ye -- ye have seen that which I have done to the Egyptians
`And now
and ye -- ye are to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation: these `are' the words which thou dost speak unto the sons of Israel.'"
And Moses cometh
and all the people answer together and say
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and have been prepared for the third day; for on the third day doth Jehovah come down before the eyes of all the people
`And thou hast made a border `for' the people round about
a hand cometh not against him
And Moses cometh down from the mount unto the people
and he saith unto the people
And it cometh to pass
And Moses bringeth out the people to meet God from the camp
and mount Sinai `is' wholly a smoke from the presence of Jehovah
and the sound of the trumpet is going on
And Jehovah cometh down on mount Sinai
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and also the priests who are coming nigh unto Jehovah do sanctify themselves
And Moses saith unto Jehovah
And Jehovah saith unto him
And Moses goeth down unto the people
