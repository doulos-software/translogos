And the people see that Moses is delaying to come down from the mount
And Aaron saith unto them
and all the people themselves break off the rings of gold which `are' in their ears
and he receiveth from their hand
And Aaron seeth
and they rise early on the morrow
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
they have turned aside hastily from the way that I have commanded them; they have made for themselves a molten calf
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and now
And Moses appeaseth the face of Jehovah his God
why do the Egyptians speak
`Be mindful of Abraham
and Jehovah repenteth of the evil which He hath spoken of doing to His people."
And Moses turneth
and the tables are the work of God
And Joshua heareth the voice of the people in their shouting
and he saith
And it cometh to pass
and he taketh the calf which they have made
And Moses saith unto Aaron
and Aaron saith
and they say to me
and I say to them
And Moses seeth the people that it `is' unbridled
and Moses standeth in the gate of the camp
and he saith to them
And the sons of Levi do according to the word of Moses
and Moses saith
And it cometh to pass
And Moses turneth back unto Jehovah
and now
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and now
And Jehovah plagueth the people
