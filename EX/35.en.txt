And Moses assembleth all the company of the sons of Israel
Six days is work done
ye do not burn a fire in any of your dwellings on the sabbath-day.'"
And Moses speaketh unto all the company of the sons of Israel
Take ye from among you a heave-offering to Jehovah; every one whose heart `is' willing doth bring it
and blue
and rams' skins made red
and oil for the light
and shoham stones
`And all the wise-hearted among you come in
`The tabernacle
`The ark and its staves
`The table and its staves
`And the candlestick for the light
`And the altar of perfume
`The altar of burnt-offering and the brazen grate which it hath
`The hangings of the court
`The pins of the tabernacle
`The coloured garments
And all the company of the sons of Israel go out from the presence of Moses
and they come in -- every man whom his heart hath lifted up
And they come in -- the men with the women -- every willing-hearted one -- they have brought in nose-ring
And every man with whom hath been found blue
every one lifting up a heave-offering of silver and brass have brought in the heave-offering of Jehovah; and every one with whom hath been found shittim wood for any work of the service brought `it' in."
And every wise-hearted woman hath spun with her hands
and all the women whose heart hath lifted them up in wisdom
And the princes have brought in the shoham stones
and the spices
every man and woman (whom their heart hath made willing to bring in for all the work which Jehovah commanded to be done by the hand of Moses) `of' the sons of Israel brought in a willing-offering to Jehovah."
And Moses saith unto the sons of Israel
and He doth fill him `with' the Spirit of God
even to devise devices to work in gold
and in graving of stones for settings
`And to direct He hath put in his heart
He hath filled them with wisdom of heart to do every work
