And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and if thou art refusing to send away
and the River hath teemed `with' frogs
yea
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And Aaron stretcheth out his hand against the waters of Egypt
and the scribes do so with their flashings
And Pharaoh calleth for Moses and for Aaron
And Moses saith to Pharaoh
and he saith
and the frogs have turned aside from thee
And Moses -- Aaron also -- goeth out from Pharaoh
and Jehovah doth according to the word of Moses
and they heap them up together
And Pharaoh seeth that there hath been a respite
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And they do so
And the scribes do so with their flashings
and the scribes say unto Pharaoh
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
for
`And I have separated in that day the land of Goshen
and I have put a division between My people and thy people: to-morrow is this sign.'"
And Jehovah doth so
And Pharaoh calleth unto Moses and to Aaron
and Moses saith
A journey of three days we go into the wilderness
And Pharaoh saith
and Moses saith
And Moses goeth out from Pharaoh
and Jehovah doth according to the word of Moses
and Pharaoh hardeneth his heart also at this time
