And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`On the first day of the month
and hast set there the ark of the testimony
and hast brought in the table
`And thou hast put the golden altar for perfume before the ark of the testimony
and hast put the altar of the burnt-offering before the opening of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting
and hast put the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar
`And thou hast set the court round about
and hast taken the anointing oil
and thou hast anointed the altar of the burnt-offering
and thou hast anointed the laver and its base
`And thou hast brought near Aaron and his sons unto the opening of the tent of meeting
and thou hast clothed Aaron with the holy garments
`And his sons thou dost bring near
and anointed them as thou hast anointed their father
And Moses doth according to all that Jehovah hath commanded him; so he hath done."
And it cometh to pass
and Moses raiseth up the tabernacle
and spreadeth the tent over the tabernacle
And he taketh and putteth the testimony unto the ark
and bringeth in the ark unto the tabernacle
And he putteth the table in the tent of meeting
and setteth in order upon it the arrangement of bread
And he putteth the candlestick in the tent of meeting
and causeth the lamps to go up before Jehovah
And he setteth the golden altar in the tent of meeting
and maketh perfume on it -- spice-perfume -- as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."
And he setteth the covering of the opening to the tabernacle
and the altar of the burnt-offering he hath set at the opening of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting
And he putteth the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar
and Moses and Aaron and his sons have washed their hands and their feet at the same;"
in their going in unto the tent of meeting
And he raiseth up the court round about the tabernacle
And the cloud covereth the tent of meeting
and Moses hath not been able to go in unto the tent of meeting
And in the going up of the cloud from off the tabernacle the sons of Israel journey in all their journeys;"
and if the cloud go not up then they journey not
for the cloud of Jehovah `is' on the tabernacle by day
