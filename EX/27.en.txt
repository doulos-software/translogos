`And thou hast made the altar of shittim wood
And thou hast made its horns on its four corners
And thou hast made its pots to remove its ashes
`And thou hast made for it a grate of net-work of brass
and hast put it under the compass of the altar beneath
`And thou hast made staves for the altar
And the staves have been brought into the rings
Hollow with boards thou dost make it
`And thou hast made the court of the tabernacle: for the south side southward
and its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets `are' of brass
and so for the north side in length
`And `for' the breadth of the court at the west side `are' hangings of fifty cubits
And `for' the breadth of the court at the east side
And the hangings at the side `are' fifteen cubits
And at the second side `are' hangings fifteen `cubits'
`And for the gate of the court a covering of twenty cubits
All the pillars of the court round about `are' filleted `with' silver
`The length of the court `is' a hundred by the cubit
even all the vessels of the tabernacle
`And thou -- thou dost command the sons of Israel
in the tent of meeting
