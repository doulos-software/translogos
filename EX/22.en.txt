`When a man doth steal an ox or sheep
`If in the breaking through
if the sun hath risen upon him
if the theft is certainly found in his hand alive
`When a man depastureth a field or vineyard
`When fire goeth forth
`When a man doth give unto his neighbour silver
`If the thief is not found
for every matter of transgression
`When a man doth give unto his neighbour an ass
an oath of Jehovah is between them both
but if it is certainly stolen from him
if it is certainly torn
`And when a man doth ask `anything' from his neighbour
if its owner `is' with it
`And when a man doth entice a virgin who `is' not betrothed
if her father utterly refuse to give her to him
`A witch thou dost not keep alive."
`Whoever lieth with a beast is certainly put to death."
`He who is sacrificing to a god
`And a sojourner thou dost not oppress
`Any widow or orphan ye do not afflict;"
if thou dost really afflict him
and Mine anger hath burned
`If thou dost lend My poor people with thee money
if thou dost at all take in pledge the garment of thy neighbour
for it alone is his covering
`God thou dost not revile
`Thy fulness and thy liquids thou dost not delay; the first-born of thy sons thou dost give to Me;"
so thou dost to thine ox
`And ye are holy men to Me
