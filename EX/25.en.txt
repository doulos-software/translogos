And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
`And this `is' the heave-offering which ye take from them; gold
and blue
and rams' skins made red
oil for the light
shoham stones
`And they have made for Me a sanctuary
according to all that which I am shewing thee
`And they have made an ark of shittim wood; two cubits and a half its length
and thou hast overlaid it `with' pure gold
`And thou hast cast for it four rings of gold
and thou hast made staves of shittim wood
and hast brought the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark
in the rings of the ark are the staves
and thou hast put unto the ark the testimony which I give unto thee."
`And thou hast made a mercy-seat of pure gold
and thou hast made two cherubs of gold
and make thou one cherub at the end on this side
`And the cherubs have been spreading out wings on high
`And thou hast put the mercy-seat on the ark above
and I have met with thee there
`And thou hast made a table of shittim wood
and hast overlaid it `with' pure gold
and hast made for it a border of a handbreadth round about
`And thou hast made to it four rings of gold
over-against the border are the rings for places for staves to bear the table;"
and thou hast made the staves of shittim wood
and thou hast made its dishes
and thou hast put on the table bread of the presence before Me continually."
`And thou hast made a candlestick of pure gold
and six branches are coming out of its sides
three calyxes made like almonds in the one branch
`And in the candlestick `are' four calyxes made like almonds
and a knop under two branches of the same
their knops and their branches are of the same
and thou hast made its seven lamps
`And its snuffers and its snuff dishes `are' of pure gold;"
of a talent of pure gold he doth make it
And see thou and do `them' by their pattern which thou art shewn in the mount."
