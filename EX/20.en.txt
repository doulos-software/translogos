`And God speaketh all these words
I `am' Jehovah thy God
`Thou hast no other Gods before Me."
`Thou dost not make to thyself a graven image
Thou dost not bow thyself to them
and doing kindness to thousands
`Thou dost not take up the name of Jehovah thy God for a vain thing
`Remember the Sabbath-day to sanctify it;"
six days thou dost labour
and the seventh day `is' a Sabbath to Jehovah thy God; thou dost not do any work
for six days hath Jehovah made the heavens and the earth
`Honour thy father and thy mother
`Thou dost not murder."
`Thou dost not commit adultery."
`Thou dost not steal."
`Thou dost not answer against thy neighbour a false testimony."
`Thou dost not desire the house of thy neighbour
And all the people are seeing the voices
and say unto Moses
And Moses saith unto the people
And the people stand afar off
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
ye do not make with Me gods of silver
`An altar of earth thou dost make for Me
`And if an altar of stones thou dost make to Me
neither dost thou go up by steps on Mine altar
