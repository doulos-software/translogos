And Jehovah saith unto Moses
for
lo
`And Jehovah hath separated between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt
and Jehovah setteth an appointed time
And Jehovah doth this thing on the morrow
and Pharaoh sendeth
And Jehovah saith unto Moses and unto Aaron
and it hath become small dust over all the land of Egypt
And they take the soot of the furnace
and the scribes have not been able to stand before Moses
And Jehovah strengtheneth the heart of Pharaoh
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
for
for now I have put forth My hand
`And yet for this I have caused thee to stand
still thou art exalting thyself against My people -- so as not to send them away;"
lo
`And
He who is fearing the word of Jehovah among the servants of Pharaoh hath caused his servants and his cattle to flee unto the houses;"
and he who hath not set his heart unto the word of Jehovah leaveth his servants and his cattle in the field."
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And Moses stretcheth out his rod towards the heavens
and there is hail
And the hail smiteth in all the land of Egypt all that `is' in the field
only in the land of Goshen
And Pharaoh sendeth
make ye supplication unto Jehovah
And Moses saith unto him
but thou and thy servants -- I have known that ye are not yet afraid of the face of Jehovah God.'"
And the flax and the barley have been smitten
and the wheat and the rye have not been smitten
And Moses goeth out from Pharaoh
and Pharaoh seeth that the rain hath ceased
and the heart of Pharaoh is strong
