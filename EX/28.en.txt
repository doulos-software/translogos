`And thou
and thou hast made holy garments for Aaron thy brother
and thou -- thou dost speak unto all the wise of heart
`And these `are' the garments which they make: a breastplate
`And they take the gold
and have made the ephod of gold
it hath two shoulders joining at its two ends
`And the girdle of his ephod which `is' on him
`And thou hast taken the two shoham stones
six of their names on the one stone
the work of an engraver in stone
`And thou hast set the two stones on the shoulders of the ephod -- stones of memorial to the sons of Israel -- and Aaron hath borne their names before Jehovah
`And thou hast made embroidered things of gold
and two chains of pure gold
`And thou hast made a breastplate of judgment
it is square
`And thou hast set in it settings of stone
and the second row `is' emerald
and the third row `is' opal
and the fourth row `is' beryl
and the stones are according to the names of the sons of Israel
`And thou hast made on the breastplate wreathed chains
and thou hast made on the breastplate two rings of gold
and thou hast put the two thick bands of gold on the two rings at the ends of the breastplate;"
and the two ends of the two thick bands thou dost put on the two embroidered things
`And thou hast made two rings of gold
and thou hast made two rings of gold
and they bind the breastplate by its rings unto the rings of the ephod with a ribbon of blue
`And Aaron hath borne the names of the sons of Israel in the breastplate of judgment
`And thou hast put unto the breastplate of judgment the Lights and the Perfections
`And thou hast made the upper robe of the ephod completely of blue
and the opening for its head hath been in its midst
`And thou hast made on its hem pomegranates of blue
a bell of gold and a pomegranate
`And it hath been on Aaron to minister in
`And thou hast made a flower of pure gold
and thou hast put it on a blue ribbon
and it hath been on the forehead of Aaron
`And thou hast embroidered the coat of linen
`And for the sons of Aaron thou dost make coats
and thou hast clothed Aaron thy brother with them
`And make thou for them linen trousers to cover the naked flesh: they are from the loins even unto the thighs;"
and they have been on Aaron and on his sons
