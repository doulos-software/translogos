And unto Moses He said
and Moses hath drawn nigh by himself unto Jehovah; and they draw not nigh
And Moses cometh in
And Moses writeth all the words of Jehovah
and he sendeth the youths of the sons of Israel
And Moses taketh half of the blood
and he taketh the Book of the Covenant
And Moses taketh the blood
And Moses goeth up
and they see the God of Israel
and unto those of the sons of Israel who are near He hath not put forth His hand
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And Moses riseth -- Joshua his minister also -- and Moses goeth up unto the mount of God;"
and unto the elders he hath said
And Moses goeth up unto the mount
and the honour of Jehovah doth tabernacle on mount Sinai
And the appearance of the honour of Jehovah `is' as a consuming fire on the top of the mount
and Moses goeth into the midst of the cloud
