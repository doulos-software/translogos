And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
and Pharaoh hath said of the sons of Israel
and I have strengthened the heart of Pharaoh
And it is declared to the king of Egypt that the people hath fled
And he harnesseth his chariot
and he taketh six hundred chosen chariots
and Jehovah strengtheneth the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt
and the Egyptians pursue after them
And Pharaoh hath drawn near
And they say unto Moses
Is not this the word which we spake unto thee in Egypt
And Moses saith unto the people
Jehovah doth fight for you
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and thou
`And I -- lo
and the Egyptians have known that I `am' Jehovah
And the messenger of God
and cometh in between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel
And Moses stretcheth out his hand towards the sea
and the sons of Israel go into the midst of the sea
And the Egyptians pursue
and it cometh to pass
and turneth aside the wheels of their chariots
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And Moses stretcheth out his hand towards the sea
and the waters turn back
And the sons of Israel have gone on dry land in the midst of the sea
and Jehovah saveth Israel in that day out of the hand of the Egyptians
and Israel seeth the great hand with which Jehovah hath wrought against the Egyptians
