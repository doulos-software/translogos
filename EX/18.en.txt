And Jethro priest of Midian
and Jethro
and her two sons
and the name of the other `is' Eliezer
And Jethro
and he saith unto Moses
And Moses goeth out to meet his father-in-law
and Moses recounteth to his father-in-law all that Jehovah hath done to Pharaoh
And Jethro rejoiceth for all the good which Jehovah hath done to Israel
and Jethro saith
now I have known that Jehovah `is' greater than all the gods
And Jethro
And it cometh to pass on the morrow
and the father-in-law of Moses seeth all that he is doing to the people
And Moses saith to his father-in-law
when they have a matter
And the father-in-law of Moses saith unto him
thou dost surely wear away
`Now
and thou hast warned them `concerning' the statutes and the laws
`And thou -- thou dost provide out of all the people men of ability
and they have judged the people at all times; and it hath come to pass
If thou dost this thing
And Moses hearkeneth to the voice of his father-in-law
and Moses chooseth men of ability out of all Israel
and they have judged the people at all times; the hard matter they bring in unto Moses
And Moses sendeth his father-in-law away
