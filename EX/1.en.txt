And these `are' the names of the sons of Israel who are coming into Egypt with Jacob; a man and his household have they come;"
Reuben
Issachar
Dan
And all the persons coming out of the thigh of Jacob are seventy persons; as to Joseph
And Joseph dieth
and the sons of Israel have been fruitful
And there riseth a new king over Egypt
and he saith unto his people
give help! let us act wisely concerning it
And they set over it princes of tribute
and as they afflict it
and the Egyptians cause the sons of Israel to serve with rigour
and make their lives bitter in hard service
And the king of Egypt speaketh to the midwives
and saith
And the midwives fear God
and the king of Egypt calleth for the midwives
And the midwives say unto Pharaoh
And God doth good to the midwives
and it cometh to pass
and Pharaoh layeth a charge on all his people
