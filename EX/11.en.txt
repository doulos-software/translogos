And Jehovah saith unto Moses
speak
And Jehovah giveth the grace of the people in the eyes of the Egyptians; also the man Moses `is' very great in the land of Egypt
And Moses saith
and every first-born in the land of Egypt hath died
and there hath been a great cry in all the land of Egypt
`And against all the sons of Israel a dog sharpeneth not its tongue
and all these thy servants have come down unto me
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and Moses and Aaron have done all these wonders before Pharaoh
