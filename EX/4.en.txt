And Moses answereth and saith
And Jehovah saith unto him
and He saith
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
`-- so that they believe that Jehovah
And Jehovah saith to him again
and He saith
`-- and it hath come to pass
`And it hath come to pass
And Moses saith unto Jehovah
And Jehovah saith unto him
and now
and he saith
And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Moses
and thou hast spoken unto him
and he
and this rod thou dost take in thy hand
And Moses goeth and turneth back unto Jethro his father-in-law
And Jehovah saith unto Moses in Midian
and Moses taketh his wife
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and thou hast said unto Pharaoh
and I say unto thee
And it cometh to pass in the way
and Zipporah taketh a flint
and He desisteth from him: then she said
And Jehovah saith unto Aaron
and Moses declareth to Aaron all the words of Jehovah with which He hath sent him
And Moses goeth -- Aaron also -- and they gather all the elders of the sons of Israel
and Aaron speaketh all the words which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses
and the people believe when they hear that Jehovah hath looked after the sons of Israel
