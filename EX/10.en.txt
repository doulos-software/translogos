And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and so that thou recountest in the ears of thy son
And Moses cometh in -- Aaron also -- unto Pharaoh
for if thou art refusing to send My people away
and it hath covered the eye of the land
and they have filled thy houses
And the servants of Pharaoh say unto him
And Moses is brought back -- Aaron also -- unto Pharaoh
And Moses saith
And he saith unto them
not so! go now
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And Moses stretcheth out his rod against the land of Egypt
And the locust goeth up against all the land of Egypt
and it covereth the eye of all the land
And Pharaoh hasteth to call for Moses and for Aaron
and now
And he goeth out from Pharaoh
and Jehovah turneth a very strong sea wind
and Jehovah strengtheneth the heart of Pharaoh
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And Moses stretcheth out his hand towards the heavens
they have not seen one another
And Pharaoh calleth unto Moses and saith
and Moses saith
and also our cattle doth go with us
And Jehovah strengtheneth the heart of Pharaoh
and Pharaoh saith to him
and Moses saith
