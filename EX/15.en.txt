Then singeth Moses and the sons of Israel this song to Jehovah
My strength and song is JAH
Jehovah `is' a man of battle; Jehovah `is' His name."
Chariots of Pharaoh and his force He hath cast into the sea; And the choice of his captains Have sunk in the Red Sea!"
The depths do cover them; They went down into the depths as a stone."
Thy right hand
And in the abundance of Thine excellency Thou throwest down Thy withstanders
And by the spirit of Thine anger Have waters been heaped together; Stood as a heap have flowings; Congealed have been depths In the heart of a sea."
The enemy said
Thou hast blown with Thy wind The sea hath covered them; They sank as lead in mighty waters."
Who `is' like Thee among the gods
Thou hast stretched out Thy right hand -- Earth swalloweth them!"
Thou hast led forth in Thy kindness The people whom Thou hast redeemed. Thou hast led on in Thy strength Unto Thy holy habitation."
Peoples have heard
Then have chiefs of Edom been troubled: Mighty ones of Moab -- Trembling doth seize them! Melted have all inhabitants of Canaan!"
Fall on them doth terror and dread; By the greatness of Thine arm They are still as a stone
Thou dost bring them in
Jehovah reigneth -- to the age
For the horse of Pharaoh hath gone in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea
And Miriam the inspired one
and Miriam answereth to them: -- `Sing ye to Jehovah
And Moses causeth Israel to journey from the Red Sea
and they come in to Marah
And the people murmur against Moses
and he crieth unto Jehovah
and He saith
And they come to Elim
