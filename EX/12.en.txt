And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron
`This month `is' to you the chief of months -- it `is' the first to you of the months of the year;"
speak ye unto all the company of Israel
`(And if the household be too few for a lamb
a lamb
`And it hath become a charge to you
and they have taken of the blood
`And they have eaten the flesh in this night
ye do not eat of it raw
and ye do not leave of it till morning
`And thus ye do eat it: your loins girded
and I have passed over through the land of Egypt during this night
`And the blood hath become a sign for you on the houses where ye `are'
`And this day hath become to you a memorial
Seven days ye eat unleavened things; only -- in the first day ye cause leaven to cease out of your houses; for any one eating anything fermented from the first day till the seventh day
`And in the first day `is' a holy convocation
and ye have observed the unleavened things
`In the first `month'
seven days leaven is not found in your houses
anything fermented ye do not eat
And Moses calleth for all the elders of Israel
and ye have taken a bunch of hyssop
`And Jehovah hath passed on to smite the Egyptians
`And ye have observed this thing
and it hath been
and it hath come to pass when your sons say unto you
that ye have said
And the people bow and do obeisance
And it cometh to pass
And Pharaoh riseth by night
and he calleth for Moses and for Aaron by night
both your flock and your herd take ye
And the Egyptians are urgent on the people
and the people taketh up its dough before it is fermented
And the sons of Israel have done according to the word of Moses
and Jehovah hath given the grace of the people in the eyes of the Egyptians
And the sons of Israel journey from Rameses to Succoth
and a great rabble also hath gone up with them
And they bake with the dough which they have brought out from Egypt unleavened cakes
And the dwelling of the sons of Israel which they have dwelt in Egypt `is' four hundred and thirty years;"
and it cometh to pass
A night of watchings it `is' to Jehovah
And Jehovah saith unto Moses and Aaron
and any man's servant
a settler or hired servant doth not eat of it;"
in one house it is eaten
all the company of Israel do keep it."
`And when a sojourner sojourneth with thee
one law is to a native
And all the sons of Israel do as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron; so have they done."
And it cometh to pass in this self-same day
