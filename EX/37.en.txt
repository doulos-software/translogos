And Bezaleel maketh the ark of shittim wood
and he overlayeth it with pure gold within and without
and he casteth for it four rings of gold
and he maketh staves of shittim wood
and he bringeth in the staves into the rings
And he maketh a mercy-seat of pure gold
and he maketh two cherubs of gold
one cherub at the end on this `side'
and the cherubs are spreading out wings on high
And he maketh the table of shittim wood; two cubits its length
and overlayeth it with pure gold
And he maketh for it a border of a handbreadth round about
and he casteth for it four rings of gold
over-against the border have the rings been
And he maketh the staves of shittim wood
and he maketh the vessels which `are' upon the table
And he maketh the candlestick of pure gold; of beaten work he hath made the candlestick
and six branches are coming out of its sides
three calyxes
And in the candlestick `are' four calyxes
and a knop under the two branches of the same
their knops and their branches have been of the same; all of it one beaten work of pure gold."
And he maketh its seven lamps
of a talent of pure gold he hath made it
And he maketh the perfume-altar of shittim wood; a cubit its length
and he overlayeth it with pure gold
and two rings of gold he hath made for it under its wreath
And he maketh the staves of shittim wood
and he maketh the holy anointing oil
