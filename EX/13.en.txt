And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Sanctify to Me every first-born
And Moses saith unto the people
To-day ye are going out
`And it hath been
`Seven days thou dost eat unleavened things
unleavened things are eaten the seven days
`And thou hast declared to thy son in that day
and it hath been to thee for a sign on thy hand
and thou hast kept this statute at its appointed season from days to days."
`And it hath been
that thou hast caused every one opening a womb to pass over to Jehovah
`And every firstling of an ass thou dost ransom with a lamb
`And it hath been
yea
and it hath been for a token on thy hand
And it cometh to pass in Pharaoh's sending the people away
and God turneth round the people the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea
And Moses taketh the bones of Joseph with him
And they journey from Succoth
and Jehovah is going before them by day in a pillar of a cloud
He removeth not the pillar of the cloud by day
