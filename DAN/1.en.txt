In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah
and the Lord giveth into his hand Jehoiakim king of Judah
And the king saith
lads in whom there is no blemish
And the king doth appoint for them a rate
And there are among them out of the sons of Judah
and the chief of the eunuchs setteth names on them
And Daniel purposeth in his heart that he will not pollute himself with the king's portion of food
And God giveth Daniel for kindness and for mercies before the chief of the eunuchs;"
and the chief of the eunuchs saith to Daniel
And Daniel saith unto the Meltzar
`Try
and our appearance is seen before thee
And he hearkeneth to them
and at the end of ten days their appearance hath appeared better and fatter in flesh then any of the lads who are eating the king's portion of food."
And the Meltzar is taking away their portion of food
As to these four lads
And at the end of the days that the king had said to bring them in
And the king speaketh with them
and `in' any matter of wisdom `and' understanding that the king hath sought of them
And Daniel is unto the first year of Cyrus the king."
