And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar
and the king saith to call for scribes
and the king saith to them
And the Chaldeans speak to the king `in' Aramaean
The king hath answered and said to the Chaldeans
and if the dream and its interpretation ye do shew
They have answered a second time
The king hath answered and said
`so' that
The Chaldeans have answered before the king
and the thing that the king is asking `is' precious
Therefore the king hath been angry and very wroth
And the sentence hath gone forth
Then Daniel hath replied `with' counsel and discretion to Arioch chief of the executioners of the king
He hath answered and said to Arioch the king's captain
and Daniel hath gone up
Then Daniel to his house hath gone
and to seek mercies from before the God of the heavens concerning this secret
Then to Daniel
Daniel hath answered and said
And He is changing times and seasons
He is revealing deep and hidden things; He hath known what `is' in darkness
Thee
Therefore Daniel hath gone up unto Arioch
Then Arioch in haste hath brought up Daniel before the king
The king hath answered and said to Daniel
Daniel hath answered before the king and said
but there is a God in the heavens
Thou
As to me -- not for `any' wisdom that is in me above any living hath this secret been revealed to me; but for the intent that the interpretation to the king they make known
`Thou
This image! its head `is' of good gold
its legs of iron
Thou wast looking till that a stone hath been cut out without hands
then broken small together have been the iron
This `is' the dream
`Thou
and whithersoever sons of men are dwelling
And after thee doth rise up another kingdom lower than those
And the fourth kingdom is strong as iron
As to that which thou hast seen: the feet and toes
As to the toes of the feet
Because thou hast seen iron mixed with miry clay
`And in the days of these kings raise up doth the God of the heavens a kingdom that is not destroyed -- to the age
Because that thou hast seen that out of the mountain cut hath been a stone without hands
Then hath king Nebuchadnezzar fallen on his face
The king hath answered Daniel and said
Then the king hath made Daniel great
And Daniel hath sought from the king
