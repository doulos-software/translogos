`And I
and
And a mighty king hath stood
and according to his standing is his kingdom broken
`And a king of the south -- even of his princes -- doth become strong
`And at the end of years they do join themselves together
`And `one' hath stood up from a branch of her roots
and also their gods
`And the king of the south hath come into the kingdom
and his sons stir themselves up
And the king of the south doth become embittered
and he hath carried away the multitude
`And the king of the north hath turned back
and in those times many do stand up against the king of the south
`And the king of the north cometh in
And he who is coming unto him doth according to his will
And he setteth his face to go in with the strength of his whole kingdom
`And he turneth back his face to the isles
And he turneth back his face to the strongholds of his land
`And stood up on his station hath `one' causing an exactor to pass over the honour of the kingdom
`And stood up on his station hath a despicable one
And the arms of the flood are overflowed from before him
And after they join themselves unto him
Peaceably even into the fertile places of the province He cometh
`And he stirreth up his power and his heart against the king of the south with a great force
and those eating his portion of food destroy him
`And both of the kings' hearts `are' to do evil
And he turneth back `to' his land with great substance
At the appointed time he turneth back
And ships of Chittim have come in against him
And strong ones out of him stand up
And those acting wickedly `against' the covenant
And the teachers of the people give understanding to many; and they have stumbled by sword
And in their stumbling
And some of the teachers do stumble for refining by them
`And the king hath done according to his will
And unto the God of his fathers he doth not attend
And to the god of strongholds
And he hath dealt in the fortresses of the strongholds with a strange god whom he hath acknowledged; he multiplieth honour
`And at the time of the end
and hath come into the desirable land
`And he sendeth forth his hand upon the lands
and he hath ruled over treasures of gold and of silver
`And reports trouble him out of the east and out of the north
and he planteth the tents of his palace between the seas and the holy desirable mountain
