In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia
`In those days
desirable bread I have not eaten
`And in the twenty and fourth day of the first month
and I lift up mine eyes
and his body as a beryl
`And I have seen -- I
and I have been left by myself
`And I hear the voice of his words
and lo
`And he saith unto me: Daniel
And he saith unto me: Do not fear
`And the head of the kingdom of Persia is standing over-against me twenty and one days
and I have come to cause thee to understand that which doth happen to thy people in the latter end of the days
`And when he speaketh with me about these things
and lo
And how is the servant of this my lord able to speak with this my lord? as for me
`And he addeth
and he saith: Do not fear
And he saith
but I declare to thee that which is noted down in the Writing of Truth
