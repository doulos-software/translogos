`I was seeing
and the rest of the beasts have caused their dominion to pass away
`I was seeing in the visions of the night
And to him is given dominion
`Pierced hath been my spirit -- I
I have drawn near unto one of those standing
`These great beasts
and receive the kingdom do the saints of the Most High
`Then I wished for certainty concerning the fourth beast
and concerning the ten horns that `are' in its heads
`I was seeing
till that the Ancient of Days hath come
`Thus he said: The fourth beast is the fourth kingdom in the earth
And the ten horns out of the kingdom `are' ten kings
and words as an adversary of the Most High it doth speak
`And the Judge is seated
and the kingdom
`Hitherto `is' the end of the matter. I
