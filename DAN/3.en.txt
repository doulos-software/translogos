Nebuchadnezzar the king hath made an image of gold
and Nebuchadnezzar the king hath sent to gather the satraps
Then are gathered the satraps
And a crier is calling mightily: `To you they are saying: O peoples
at the time that ye hear the voice of the cornet
and whoso doth not fall down and do obeisance
Therefore at that time
Therefore at that time drawn near have certain Chaldeans
they have answered
Thou
and whoso doth not fall down and do obeisance
There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the work of the province of Babylon -- Shadrach
Then Nebuchadnezzar
Nebuchadnezzar hath answered and said to them
Now
Shadrach
Lo
And lo -- not! be it known to thee
Then Nebuchadnezzar hath been full of fury
and to certain mighty men who `are' in his force he hath said to bind Shadrach
Then these men have been bound in their coats
Therefore
And these three men
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king hath been astonished
He answered and hath said
Then Nebuchadnezzar hath drawn near to the gate of the burning fiery furnace; he hath answered and said
and gathered together
Nebuchadnezzar hath answered and hath said
And by me a decree is made
Then the king hath caused Shadrach
