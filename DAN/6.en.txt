It hath been good before Darius
and higher than they three presidents
Then this Daniel hath been overseer over the presidents and satraps
Then the presidents and satraps have been seeking to find a cause of complaint against Daniel concerning the kingdom
Then these men are saying
Then these presidents and satraps have assembled near the king
Taken counsel have all the presidents of the kingdom
Now
Therefore king Darius hath signed the writing and interdict."
And Daniel
Then these men have assembled
then they have come near
Then they have answered
Then the king
Then these men have assembled near the king
Then the king hath said
And a stone hath been brought and placed at the mouth of the den
Then hath the king gone to his palace
Then doth the king rise in the early morning
and at his coming near to the den
Then Daniel hath spoken with the king: `O king
my God hath sent His messenger
Then was the king very glad for him
And the king hath said
Then Darius the king hath written to all the peoples
From before me is made a decree
A deliverer
And this Daniel hath prospered in the reign of Darius
