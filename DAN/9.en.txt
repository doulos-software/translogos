In the first year of Darius
in the first year of his reign
and I set my face unto the Lord God
And I pray to Jehovah my God
we have sinned
and we have not hearkened unto Thy servants
`To Thee
`O Lord
`To the Lord our God `are' the mercies and the forgivenesses
and have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah our God
and all Israel have transgressed Thy law
`And He confirmeth His words that He hath spoken against us
as it is written in the law of Moses
And Jehovah doth watch for the evil
And now
`O Lord
and now
`Incline
O lord
And while I am speaking
yea
And he giveth understanding
at the commencement of thy supplications hath the word come forth
`Seventy weeks are determined for thy people
And thou dost know
And after the sixty and two weeks
And he hath strengthened a covenant with many -- one week
