`Nebuchadnezzar the king to all peoples
The signs and wonders that God Most High hath done with me
His signs how great! and His wonders how mighty! His kingdom `is' a kingdom age-during

And by me a decree is made
Then coming up are the scribes
And at last come up before me hath Daniel
`O Belteshazzar
As to the visions of my head on my bed

its leaves `are' fair
`I was looking

by the decree of the sifters `is' the sentence
`This dream I have seen
`Then Daniel
The tree that thou hast seen
and its leaves `are' fair
`Thou it `is'
and that which the king hath seen -- a sifter
`This `is' the interpretation
and they are driving thee away from men
And that which they said -- to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom for thee abideth
`Therefore
`All -- hath come on Nebuchadnezzar the king."
`At the end of twelve months
the king hath answered and said
`While the word is `in' the king's mouth a voice from the heavens hath fallen: To thee they are saying: O Nebuchadnezzar the king
and from men they are driving thee away
`In that hour the thing hath been fulfilled on Nebuchadnezzar
`And at the end of the days I
and all who are dwelling on the earth as nothing are reckoned
`At that time my understanding doth return unto me
`Now
