Belshazzar the king hath made a great feast to a thousand of his great men
Belshazzar hath said -- while tasting the wine -- to bring in the vessels of gold and of silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple that `is' in Jerusalem
Then they have brought in the vessels of gold that had been taken out of the temple of the house of God that `is' in Jerusalem
they have drunk wine
In that hour come forth have fingers of a man's hand
then the king's countenance hath changed
Call doth the king mightily
Then coming up are all the wise men of the king
then the king Belshazzar is greatly troubled
The queen
there is a man in thy kingdom in whom `is' the spirit of the holy gods: and
because that an excellent spirit
Then Daniel hath been caused to come up before the king; answered hath the king
And I have heard of thee
`And now
and I -- I have heard of thee
Then hath Daniel answered and said before the king
thou
and because of the greatness that He gave to him
and when his heart was high
and from the sons of men he is driven
`And thou
and against the Lord of the heavens thou hast lifted up thyself; and the vessels of His house they have brought in before thee
`Then from before Him sent is the extremity of the hand
and this `is' the writing that is noted down: Numbered
This `is' the interpretation of the thing: Numbered -- God hath numbered thy kingdom
Weighed -- Thou art weighed in the balances
Divided -- Divided is thy kingdom
Then hath Belshazzar said
In that night Belshazzar king of the Chaldeans is slain
and Darius the Mede hath received the kingdom
