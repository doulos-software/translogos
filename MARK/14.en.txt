And the passover and the unleavened food were after two days
and they said
And he
and there were certain much displeased within themselves
for this could have been sold for more than three hundred denaries
And Jesus said
for the poor always ye have with you
what she could she did
Verily I say to you
And Judas the Iscariot
and having heard
And the first day of the unleavened food
And he sendeth forth two of his disciples
and wherever he may go in
and he will shew you a large upper room
And his disciples went forth
And evening having come
and as they are reclining
And they began to be sorrowful
And he answering said to them
the Son of Man doth indeed go
And as they are eating
And having taken the cup
and he said to them
verily I say to you
And having sung an hymn
and Jesus saith to them -- `All ye shall be stumbled at me this night
but after my having risen I will go before you to Galilee.'"
And Peter said to him
And Jesus said to him
And he spake the more vehemently
And they come to a spot
and he taketh Peter
and he saith to them
And having gone forward a little
and he said
And he cometh
Watch ye and pray
And again having gone away
and having returned
And he cometh the third time
rise
And immediately -- while he is yet speaking -- cometh near Judas
and he who is delivering him up had given a token to them
and having come
And they laid on him their hands
and a certain one of those standing by
And Jesus answering said to them
daily I was with you in the temple teaching
And having left him they all fled;"
and a certain young man was following him
and he
And they led away Jesus unto the chief priest
and Peter afar off did follow him
And the chief priests and all the sanhedrim were seeking against Jesus testimony -- to put him to death
for many were bearing false testimony against him
And certain having risen up
`We heard him saying -- I will throw down this sanctuary made with hands
and neither so was their testimony alike."
And the chief priest
and he was keeping silent
and Jesus said
And the chief priest
Ye heard the evil speaking
and certain began to spit on him
And Peter being in the hall beneath
and having seen Peter warming himself
and he denied
And the maid having seen him again
and he was again denying. And after a little again
and he began to anathematize
and a second time a cock crew
