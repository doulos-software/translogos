And when they come nigh to Jerusalem
and saith to them
and if any one may say to you
And they went away
and certain of those standing there said to them
and they said to them as Jesus commanded
And they brought the colt unto Jesus
and many did spread their garments in the way
And those going before and those following were crying out
blessed is the coming reign
And Jesus entered into Jerusalem
And on the morrow
and having seen a fig-tree afar off having leaves
and Jesus answering said to it
And they come to Jerusalem
and he did not suffer that any might bear a vessel through the temple
and he was teaching
And the scribes and the chief priests heard
and when evening came
And in the morning
and Peter having remembered saith to him
And Jesus answering saith to them
for verily I say to you
Because of this I say to you
`And whenever ye may stand praying
and
And they come again to Jerusalem
and they say to him
And Jesus answering said to them
the baptism of John -- from heaven was it? or from men? answer me.'"
And they were reasoning with themselves
But if we may say
and answering they say to Jesus
