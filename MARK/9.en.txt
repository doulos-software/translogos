And he said to them
And after six days doth Jesus take Peter
and his garments became glittering
And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses
And Peter answering saith to Jesus
for he was not knowing what he might say
And there came a cloud overshadowing them
and suddenly
And as they are coming down from the mount
and the thing they kept to themselves
And they were questioning him
And he answering said to them
But I say to you
And having come unto the disciples
and immediately
And he questioned the scribes
and one out of the multitude answering said
and wherever it doth seize him
And he answering him
and they brought him unto him
And he questioned his father
and many times also it cast him into fire
And Jesus said to him
and immediately the father of the child
Jesus having seen that a multitude doth run together
and having cried
but Jesus
And he having come into the house
And he said to them
And having gone forth thence
for he was teaching his disciples
but they were not understanding the saying
And he came to Capernaum
and they were silent
and having sat down he called the twelve
And having taken a child
`Whoever may receive one of such children in my name
And John did answer him
And Jesus said
for he who is not against us is for us;"
for whoever may give you to drink a cup of water in my name
and whoever may cause to stumble one of the little ones believing in me
`And if thy hand may cause thee to stumble
where there worm is not dying
`And if thy foot may cause thee to stumble
where there worm is not dying
And if thine eye may cause thee to stumble
where their worm is not dying
for every one with fire shall be salted
The salt `is' good
