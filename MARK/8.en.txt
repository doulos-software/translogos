In those days the multitude being very great
`I have compassion upon the multitude
and if I shall let them away fasting to their home
And his disciples answered him
And he was questioning them
And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground
And they had a few small fishes
and they did eat and were filled
and those eating were about four thousand. And he let them away
and immediately having entered into the boat with his disciples
and the Pharisees came forth
and having sighed deeply in his spirit
And having left them
and they forgot to take loaves
and he was charging them
and they were reasoning with one another
And Jesus having known
Having eyes
When the five loaves I did brake to the five thousand
`And when the seven to the four thousand
And he said to them
And he cometh to Bethsaida
and having taken the hand of the blind man
and he
Afterwards again he put `his' hands on his eyes
and he sent him away to his house
And Jesus went forth
And they answered
And he saith to them
And he strictly charged them that they may tell no one about it
and began to teach them
and openly he was speaking the word. And Peter having taken him aside
and he
And having called near the multitude
for whoever may will to save his life shall lose it; and whoever may lose his life for my sake and for the good news' sake
for what shall it profit a man
Or what shall a man give as an exchange for his life?"
for whoever may be ashamed of me
