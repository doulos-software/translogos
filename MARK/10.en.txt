And having risen thence
And the Pharisees
and he answering said to them
and they said
And Jesus answering said to them
but from the beginning of the creation
on this account shall a man leave his father and mother
and they shall be -- the two -- for one flesh; so that they are no more two
what therefore God did join together
And in the house again his disciples of the same thing questioned him
and he saith to them
and if a woman may put away her husband
And they were bringing to him children
and Jesus having seen
verily I say to you
and having taken them in his arms
And as he is going forth into the way
And Jesus said to him
the commands thou hast known: Thou mayest not commit adultery
And he answering said to him
And Jesus having looked upon him
And he -- gloomy at the word -- went away sorrowing
And Jesus having looked round
And the disciples were astonished at his words
It is easier for a camel through the eye of the needle to enter
And they were astonished beyond measure
And Jesus
And Peter began to say to him
And Jesus answering said
who may not receive an hundredfold now in this time
and many first shall be last
And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem
-- `Lo
and they shall mock him
And there come near to him James and John
and he said to them
and they said to him
and Jesus said to them
And they said to him
but to sit on my right and on my left
And the ten having heard
but Jesus having called them near
but not so shall it be among you; but whoever may will to become great among you
and whoever of you may will to become first
for even the Son of Man came not to be ministered to
And they come to Jericho
and having heard that it is Jesus the Nazarene
and many were rebuking him
And Jesus having stood
and he
And answering
and Jesus said to him
