And again he entered into Capernaum
and immediately many were gathered together
And they come unto him
and not being able to come near to him because of the multitude
and Jesus having seen their faith
And there were certain of the scribes there sitting
`Why doth this one thus speak evil words? who is able to forgive sins except one -- God?'"
And immediately Jesus
which is easier
`And
I say to thee
and he rose immediately
And he went forth again by the sea
and passing by
And it came to pass
And the scribes and the Pharisees
And Jesus
And the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees were fasting
And Jesus said to them
but days shall come when the bridegroom may be taken from them
`And no one a patch of undressed cloth doth sew on an old garment
and no one doth put new wine into old skins
And it came to pass -- he is going along on the sabbaths through the corn-fields -- and his disciples began to make a way
and the Pharisees said to him
And he said to them
how he went into the house of God
And he said to them
so that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath.'"
