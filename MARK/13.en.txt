And as he is going forth out of the temple
and Jesus answering said to him
And as he is sitting at the mount of the Olives
`Tell us when these things shall be? and what `is' the sign when all these may be about to be fulfilled?'"
And Jesus answering them
for many shall come in my name
and when ye may hear of wars and reports of wars
for nation shall rise against nation
`And take ye heed to yourselves
and to all the nations it behoveth first that the good news be proclaimed."
`And when they may lead you
`And brother shall deliver up brother to death
and ye shall be hated by all because of my name
`And when ye may see the abomination of the desolation
and he upon the house-top
and he who is in the field
`And wo to those with child
and pray ye that your flight may not be in winter
for those days shall be tribulation
and if the Lord did not shorten the days
`And then
for there shall rise false Christs and false prophets
and ye
`But in those days
and the stars of the heaven shall be falling
`And then they shall see the Son of Man coming in clouds with much power and glory
and then he shall send his messengers
`And from the fig-tree learn ye the simile: when the branch may already become tender
so ye
Verily I say to you
the heaven and the earth shall pass away
`And concerning that day and the hour no one hath known -- not even the messengers who are in the heaven
Take heed
as a man who is gone abroad
watch ye
lest
and what I say to you
