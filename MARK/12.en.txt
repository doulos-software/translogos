And he began to speak to them in similes: `A man planted a vineyard
and he sent unto the husbandmen at the due time a servant
and they
`And again he sent unto them another servant
`And again he sent another
`Having yet therefore one son -- his beloved -- he sent also him unto them last
and those husbandmen said among themselves -- This is the heir
and having taken him
`What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen

from the Lord was this
And they were seeking to lay hold on him
and they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians
and they having come
And he
and they brought
and Jesus answering said to them
And the Sadducees come unto him
`Teacher
`There were then seven brothers
and the second took her
and the seven took her
in the rising again
And Jesus answering said to them
for when they may rise out of the dead
`And concerning the dead
he is not the God of dead men

therefore David himself saith of him Lord
and he was saying to them in his teaching
and first seats in the synagogues
who are devouring the widows' houses
And Jesus having sat down over-against the treasury
and having come
And having called near his disciples
for all
