And he went forth thence
and sabbath having come
Is not this the carpenter
And Jesus said to them -- `A prophet is not without honor
and he was not able there any mighty work to do
and he wondered because of their unbelief. And he was going round the villages
and he doth call near the twelve
and he commanded them that they may take nothing for the way
but having been shod with sandals
And he said to them
and as many as may not receive you
And having gone forth they were preaching that `men' might reform
and many demons they were casting out
And the king Herod heard
Others said -- `It is Elijah
And Herod having heard
For Herod himself
for John said to Herod -- `It is not lawful to thee to have the wife of thy brother;'"
and Herodias was having a quarrel with him
for Herod was fearing John
And a seasonable day having come
and the daughter of that Herodias having come in
and he sware to her -- `Whatever thou mayest ask me
And she
and having come in immediately with haste unto the king
And the king -- made very sorrowful -- because of the oaths and of those reclining (at meat) with him
and immediately the king having sent a guardsman
and he having gone
and having heard
And the apostles are gathered together unto Jesus
and he said to them
and they went away to a desert place
And the multitudes saw them going away
and having come forth
And now the hour being advanced
let them away
And he answering said to them
And he saith to them
And he commanded them to make all recline in companies upon the green grass
and they sat down in squares
And having taken the five loaves and the two fishes
and they did all eat
and they took up of broken pieces twelve hand-baskets full
and those eating of the loaves were about five thousand men."
And immediately he constrained his disciples to go into the boat
and having taken leave of them
And evening having come
and he saw them harassed in the rowing
And they having seen him walking on the sea
for they all saw him
And he went up unto them to the boat
for they understood not concerning the loaves
And having passed over
and they having come forth out of the boat
having run about through all that region round about
and wherever he was going
