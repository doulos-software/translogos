And again he began to teach by the sea
and he taught them many things in similes
`Hearken
and it came to pass
and other fell upon the rocky ground
and the sun having risen
and other fell toward the thorns
and other fell to the good ground
And he said to them
And when he was alone
and he said to them
that seeing they may see and not perceive
And he saith to them
He who is sowing doth sow the word;"
and these are they by the way where the word is sown: and whenever they may hear
`And these are they
and have not root in themselves
`And these are they who toward the thorns are sown: these are they who are hearing the word
and the anxieties of this age
`And these are they who on the good ground have been sown: who do hear the word
And he said to them
for there is not anything hid that may not be manifested
If any hath ears to hear -- let him hear.'"
And he said to them
for whoever may have
And he said
and may sleep
for of itself doth the earth bear fruit
and whenever the fruit may yield itself
And he said
As a grain of mustard
and whenever it may be sown
And with many such similes he was speaking to them the word
and without a simile he was not speaking to them
And he saith to them on that day
and having let away the multitude
And there cometh a great storm of wind
and he himself was upon the stern
And having waked up
and he said to them
and they feared a great fear
