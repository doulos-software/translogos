And gathered together unto him are the Pharisees
and having seen certain of his disciples with defiled hands -- that is
for the Pharisees
and
Then question him do the Pharisees and the scribes
and he answering said to them -- `Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you
and in vain do they worship Me
for
And he said to them
for Moses said
and ye say
and no more do ye suffer him to do anything for his father or for his mother
setting aside the word of God for your tradition that ye delivered; and many such like things ye do.'"
And having called near all the multitude
there is nothing from without the man entering into him that is able to defile him
If any hath ears to hear -- let him hear.'"
And when he entered into a house from the multitude
and he saith to them
because it doth not enter into his heart
And he said -- `That which is coming out from the man
for from within
thefts
all these evils do come forth from within
And from thence having risen
for a woman having heard about him
and the woman was a Greek
And Jesus said to her
And she answered and saith to him
And he said to her
and having come away to her house
And again
and they bring to him a deaf
And having taken him away from the multitude by himself
and having looked to the heaven
and immediately were his ears opened
And he charged them that they may tell no one
and they were being beyond measure astonished
