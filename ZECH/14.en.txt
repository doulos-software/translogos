Lo
And I have gathered all the nations unto Jerusalem to battle
And gone forth hath Jehovah
And stood have His feet
And ye have fled `to' the valley of My mountains
And it hath come to pass
And there hath been one day
And it hath come to pass
And Jehovah hath become king over all the land
Changed is all the land as a plain
And they have dwelt in her
And this is the plague with which Jehovah Doth plague all the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem
And it hath come to pass
And also Judah is fought with in Jerusalem
And so is the plague of the horse
And it hath come to pass
And it hath come to pass
And if the family of Egypt go not up
This is the punishment of the sin of Egypt
In that day there is on bells of the horse
And every pot in Jerusalem
