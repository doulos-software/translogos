And I turn back
In the first chariot `are' red horses
and in the third chariot white horses
And I answer and say unto the messenger who is speaking with me
And the messenger answereth and saith unto me
The brown horses that `are' therein
and the strong ones have come forth
And he calleth me
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
to take of the captivity (who came from Babylon) from Heldai
and thou hast taken silver and gold
and hast spoken unto him
Yea
And the crown is to Helem
And the far-off come in
