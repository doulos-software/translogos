Open
Howl
A voice of the howling of the shepherds! For destroyed was their robe of honour
Thus said Jehovah my God: `Feed the flock of the slaughter
Whose buyers slay them
For I have pity no more on inhabitants of the land
And I feed the flock of slaughter
And I cut off the three shepherds in one month
And I say
And I take My staff Pleasantness
and it is broken in that day
And I say unto them: `If good in your eyes
And Jehovah saith unto me
And I cut asunder my second staff
And Jehovah saith unto me
For lo
Wo `to' the worthless shepherd
