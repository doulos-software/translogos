The burden of a word of Jehovah on Israel. An affirmation of Jehovah
Lo
And it hath come to pass
In that day -- an affirmation of Jehovah
And leaders of Judah have said in their heart
In that day I make the leaders of Judah As a hearth of fire among trees
And saved hath Jehovah the tents of Judah first
In that day cover over doth Jehovah the inhabitant of Jerusalem
And it hath come to pass
And I have poured on the house of David
In that day
And mourned hath the land -- every family apart
The family of the house of Levi apart
All the families that are left
