The burden of a word of Jehovah against the land of Hadrach
And also Hamath doth border thereon
And Tyre doth build a bulwark to herself
Lo
See doth Ashkelon and fear
And dwelt hath a foreigner in Ashdod
And turned aside his blood from his mouth
And I have pitched for My house a camp
Rejoice exceedingly
And I have cut off the chariot from Ephraim
Also thou -- by the blood of thy covenant
Turn back to a fenced place
For I have trodden for Me Judah
And Jehovah doth appear for them
Jehovah of Hosts doth cover them over
And saved them hath Jehovah their God In that day
For what His goodness! and what His beauty! Corn the young men
