And it cometh to pass
And Beth-El sendeth Sherezer and Regem-Melech
speaking unto the priests who `are' at the house of Jehovah of Hosts
And there is a word of Jehovah of Hosts unto me
`Speak unto all the people of the land
When ye fasted with mourning in the fifth and in the seventh `months' -- even these seventy years -- did ye keep the fast `to' Me -- Me? And when ye eat
`Are not `these' the words that Jehovah proclaimed by the hand of the former prophets
And there is a word of Jehovah unto Zechariah
`Thus spake Jehovah of Hosts
And widow
And they refuse to attend
And their heart they have made adamant
And it cometh to pass
And I toss them on all the nations
