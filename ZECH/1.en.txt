In the eighth month
`Jehovah was wroth against your fathers -- wrath!"
And thou hast said unto them
Ye shall not be as your fathers
Your fathers -- where `are' they? And the prophets -- to the age do they live?"
Only
On the twenty and fourth day of the eleventh month
I have seen by night
And I say
And the one who is standing between the myrtles doth answer and say
And they answer the messenger of Jehovah who is standing between the myrtles
And the messenger of Jehovah answereth and saith
And Jehovah answereth the messenger
And the messenger who is speaking with me
And `with' great wrath I am wroth against the nations who are at ease
Therefore
Again call
And I lift up mine eyes
And I say unto the messenger who is speaking with me
And Jehovah doth shew me four artizans."
And I say
