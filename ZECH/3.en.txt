And he sheweth me Joshua the high priest standing before the messenger of Jehovah
And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary: `Jehovah doth push against thee
And Joshua was clothed with filthy garments
And he answereth and speaketh unto those standing before him
He also said
and the messenger of Jehovah doth protest to Joshua
`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: If in My ways thou dost walk
Hear
For lo
In that day -- an affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts
