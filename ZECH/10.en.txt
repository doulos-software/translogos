They asked of Jehovah rain in a time of latter rain
Because the teraphim did speak iniquity
Against the shepherds did Mine anger burn
From him `is' a corner-stone
And they have been as heroes
And I have made mighty the house of Judah
And Ephraim hath been as a hero
I hist for them
And I sow them among peoples
And I have brought them back from the land of Egypt
And He hath passed over through the sea
And I have made them mighty in Jehovah
