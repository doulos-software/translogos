And I lift up mine eyes
And I say
And lo
and he saith unto him
And I -- I am to her -- an affirmation of Jehovah
Ho
Ho
For thus said Jehovah of Hosts: After honour He hath sent me unto the nations who are spoiling you
For lo
Singe
And joined have been many nations unto Jehovah in that day
And Jehovah hath inherited Judah
Hush
