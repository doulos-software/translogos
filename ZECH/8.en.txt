And there is a word of Jehovah of Hosts
`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: I have been zealous for Zion with great zeal
Thus said Jehovah: I have turned back unto Zion
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Again dwell do old men and old women
And broad places of the city are full of boys and girls
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Surely it is wonderful in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Lo
And I have brought them in
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Let your hands be strong
For
And now
Because of the sowing of peace
And it hath come to pass
For
So I have turned back
These `are' the things that ye do: Speak ye truth each with his neighbour
And each the evil of his neighbour ye do not devise in your heart
And there is a word of Jehovah of Hosts unto me
`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: The fast of the fourth
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Yet come do peoples
Yea
Yea
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: In those days take hold do ten men of all languages of the nations
