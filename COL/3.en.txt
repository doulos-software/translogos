If
the things above mind ye
for ye did die
when the Christ -- our life -- may be manifested
Put to death
because of which things cometh the anger of God upon the sons of the disobedience
in which also ye -- ye did walk once
but now put off
Lie not one to another
and having put on the new
where there is not Greek and Jew
Put on
forbearing one another
and above all these things
and let the peace of God rule in your hearts
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly
and all
The wives! be subject to your own husbands
the husbands! love your wives
the children! obey the parents in all things
the fathers! vex not your children
The servants! obey in all things those who are masters according to the flesh
and all
having known that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance -- for the Lord Christ ye serve;"
and he who is doing unrighteously shall receive what he did unrighteously
