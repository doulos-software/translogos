Paul
to the saints in Colossae
We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus
because of the hope that is laid up for you in the heavens
which is present to you
as ye also learned from Epaphras
who also did declare to us your love in the Spirit."
Because of this
to your walking worthily of the Lord to all pleasing
in all might being made mighty according to the power of His glory
Giving thanks to the Father who did make us meet for the participation of the inheritance of the saints in the light
who did rescue us out of the authority of the darkness
in whom we have the redemption through his blood
who is the image of the invisible God
because in him were the all things created
and himself is before all
And himself is the head of the body -- the assembly -- who is a beginning
because in him it did please all the fulness to tabernacle
and through him to reconcile the all things to himself -- having made peace through the blood of his cross -- through him
And you -- once being alienated
in the body of his flesh through the death
if also ye remain in the faith
I now rejoice in my sufferings for you
of which I -- I did become a ministrant according to the dispensation of God
the secret that hath been hid from the ages and from the generations
to whom God did will to make known what `is' the riches of the glory of this secret among the nations -- which is Christ in you
whom we proclaim
for which also I labour
