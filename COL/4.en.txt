The masters! that which is righteous and equal to the servants give ye
In the prayer continue ye
praying at the same time also for us
that I may manifest it
in wisdom walk ye toward those without
your word always in grace -- with salt being seasoned -- to know how it behoveth you to answer each one."
All the things concerning me make known to you shall Tychicus -- the beloved brother
whom I did send unto you for this very thing
with Onesimus the faithful and beloved brother
Salute you doth Aristarchus
and Jesus who is called Justus
Salute you doth Epaphras
for I do testify to him
Salute you doth Lukas
salute ye those in Laodicea -- brethren
and when the epistle may be read with you
and say to Archippus
The salutation by the hand of me
