For I wish you to know how great a conflict I have for you and those in Laodicea
that their hearts may be comforted
in whom are all the treasures of the wisdom and the knowledge hid
and this I say
for if even in the flesh I am absent -- yet in the spirit I am with you
as
being rooted and built up in him
See that no one shall be carrying you away as spoil through the philosophy and vain deceit
because in him doth tabernacle all the fulness of the Godhead bodily
and ye are in him made full
in whom also ye were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands
being buried with him in the baptism
And you -- being dead in the trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh -- He made alive together with him
having blotted out the handwriting in the ordinances that is against us
having stripped the principalities and the authorities
Let no one
which are a shadow of the coming things
let no one beguile you of your prize
and not holding the head
If
-- thou mayest not touch
which are all for destruction with the using
which are
