In the seventh `month'
`Speak
Who among you hath been left that saw this house in its former honour? And what are ye seeing it now? Is it not
And now
The thing that I covenanted with you
For thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Yet once more -- it `is' a little
And I have shaken all the nations
Mine `is' the silver
Greater is the honour of this latter house
On the twenty and fourth of the ninth `month'
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: `Ask
Lo
And Haggai saith
And Haggai answereth and saith
And now
From that time `one' hath come to a heap of twenty
I have smitten you with blasting
Set `it'
Is the seed yet in the barn? And hitherto the vine and the fig
And there is a word of Jehovah a second time unto Haggai
`Speak unto Zerubbabel governor of Judah
And have overturned the throne of kingdoms
In that day -- an affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts
