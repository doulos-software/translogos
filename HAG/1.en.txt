In the second year of Darius the king
Thus spake Jehovah of Hosts
And there is a word of Jehovah by the hand of Haggai the prophet
Is it time for you -- you! To dwell in your covered houses
And now
Ye have sown much
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Set your heart to your ways."
Go up the mountain
Looking for much
Therefore
And I proclaim draught on the land
And Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel
And Haggai
And Jehovah doth stir up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel
in the twenty and fourth day of the sixth month
