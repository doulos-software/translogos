Let brotherly love remain;"
of the hospitality be not forgetful
be mindful of those in bonds
honourable `is' the marriage in all
Without covetousness the behaviour
so that we do boldly say
Be mindful of those leading you
Jesus Christ yesterday and to-day the same
with teachings manifold and strange be not carried about
we have an altar
for of those beasts whose blood is brought for sin into the holy places through the chief priest -- of these the bodies are burned without the camp."
Wherefore
now
for we have not here an abiding city
through him
and of doing good
Be obedient to those leading you
Pray for us
and more abundantly do I call upon `you' to do this
And the God of the peace
make you perfect in every good work to do His will
And I entreat you
Know ye that the brother Timotheus is released
Salute all those leading you
the grace `is' with you all! Amen."
