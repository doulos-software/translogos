For every chief priest -- out of men taken -- in behalf of men is set in things `pertaining' to God
able to be gentle to those ignorant and going astray
and because of this infirmity he ought
and no one to himself doth take the honour
so also the Christ did not glorify himself to become chief priest
as also in another `place' He saith
who in the days of his flesh both prayers and supplications unto Him who was able to save him from death -- with strong crying and tears -- having offered up
through being a Son
and having been made perfect
having been addressed by God a chief priest
concerning whom we have much discourse and of hard explanation to say
for even owing to be teachers
for every one who is partaking of milk `is' unskilled in the word of righteousness -- for he is an infant
and of perfect men is the strong food
