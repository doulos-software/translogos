In many parts
in these last days did speak to us in a Son
who being the brightness of the glory
having become so much better than the messengers
For to which of the messengers said He ever
and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world
and unto the messengers
and unto the Son: `Thy throne
thou didst love righteousness
and
these shall perish
and as a mantle Thou shall roll them together
And unto which of the messengers said He ever
are they not all spirits of service -- for ministration being sent forth because of those about to inherit salvation?"
