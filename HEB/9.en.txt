It had
for a tabernacle was prepared
and after the second vail a tabernacle that is called `Holy of holies
having a golden censer
and over it cherubim of the glory
And these things having been thus prepared
and into the second
the Holy Spirit this evidencing that not yet hath been manifested the way of the holy `places'
which `is' a simile in regard to the present time
only in victuals
And Christ being come
neither through blood of goats and calves
for if the blood of bulls
how much more shall the blood of the Christ (who through the age-during Spirit did offer himself unblemished to God) purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
And because of this
for where a covenant `is'
for a covenant over dead victims `is' stedfast
whence not even the first apart from blood hath been initiated
for every command having been spoken
saying
and both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service with blood in like manner he did sprinkle
and with blood almost all things are purified according to the law
`It is' necessary
for not into holy places made with hands did the Christ enter -- figures of the true -- but into the heaven itself
nor that he may many times offer himself
since it had behoved him many times to suffer from the foundation of the world
and as it is laid up to men once to die
so also the Christ
