We may fear
for we also are having good news proclaimed
for we do enter into the rest -- we who did believe
for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh `day' thus: `And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;'"
and in this `place' again
since then
again He doth limit a certain day
for if Joshua had given them rest
there doth remain
for he who did enter into his rest
May we be diligent
for the reckoning of God is living
and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him
Having
for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathise with our infirmities
we may come near
