Wherefore
being stedfast to Him who did appoint him
for of more glory than Moses hath this one been counted worthy
for every house is builded by some one
and Moses indeed `was' stedfast in all his house
and Christ
Wherefore
ye may not harden your hearts
in which tempt Me did your fathers
wherefore I was grieved with that generation
so I sware in My anger
See
but exhort ye one another every day
for partakers we have become of the Christ
in its being said
for certain having heard did provoke
but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with those who did sin
and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His rest
and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief."
