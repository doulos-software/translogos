For this Melchisedek
to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide
without father
And see how great this one `is'
and those
and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them
and apart from all controversy
and here
and so to speak
for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him."
If indeed
for the priesthood being changed
for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath had part
for `it is' evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord
And it is yet more abundantly most evident
who came not according to the law of a fleshly command
for He doth testify -- `Thou `art' a priest -- to the age
for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going before because of its weakness
(for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a better hope
And inasmuch as `it is' not apart from oath
and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him
by so much of a better covenant hath Jesus become surety
and those indeed are many who have become priests
and he
whence also he is able to save to the very end
For such a chief priest did become us -- kind
who hath no necessity daily
for the law doth appoint men chief priests
