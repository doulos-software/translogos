And the sum concerning the things spoken of `is': we have such a chief priest
of the holy places a servant
for every chief priest to offer both gifts and sacrifices is appointed
for if
who unto an example and shadow do serve of the heavenly things
and now he hath obtained a more excellent service
for if that first were faultless
For finding fault
not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
because this `is' the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
and they shall not teach each his neighbour
because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness
in the saying `new
