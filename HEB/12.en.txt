Therefore
looking to the author and perfecter of faith -- Jesus
for consider again him who endured such gainsaying from the sinners to himself
Not yet unto blood did ye resist -- with the sin striving;"
and ye have forgotten the exhortation that doth speak fully with you as with sons
for whom the Lord doth love He doth chasten
if chastening ye endure
and if ye are apart from chastening
Then
for they
and all chastening for the present
Wherefore
and straight paths make for your feet
peace pursue with all
looking diligently over lest any one be failing of the grace of God
lest any one be a fornicator
for ye know that also afterwards
For ye came not near to the mount touched and scorched with fire
and a sound of a trumpet
for they were not bearing that which is commanded
and
But
to the company and assembly of the first-born in heaven enrolled
and to a mediator of a new covenant -- Jesus
See
whose voice the earth shook then
and this -- `Yet once' -- doth make evident the removal of the things shaken
wherefore
for also our God `is' a consuming fire."
