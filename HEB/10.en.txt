For the law having a shadow of the coming good things -- not the very image of the matters
since
but in those `sacrifices' is a remembrance of sins every year
for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take away sins."
Wherefore
in burnt-offerings
then I said
saying above -- `Sacrifice
then he said
in the which will we are having been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once
and every priest
And He
as to the rest
for by one offering he hath perfected to the end those sanctified;"
and testify to us also doth the Holy Spirit
`This `is' the covenant that I will make with them after those days
and `their sins and their lawlessness I will remember no more;'"
and where forgiveness of these `is'
Having
which way he did initiate for us -- new and living
and a high priest over the house of God
may we draw near with a true heart
may we hold fast the unwavering profession of the hope
and may we consider one another to provoke to love and to good works
not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together
For we -- willfully sinning after the receiving the full knowledge of the truth -- no more for sins doth there remain a sacrifice
but a certain fearful looking for of judgment
any one who did set at nought a law of Moses
of how much sorer punishment shall he be counted worthy who the Son of God did trample on
for we have known Him who is saying
fearful `is' the falling into the hands of a living God."
And call to your remembrance the former days
partly both with reproaches and tribulations being made spectacles
for also with my bonds ye sympathised
Ye may not cast away
for of patience ye have need
for yet a very very little
and `the righteous by faith shall live
and we are not of those drawing back to destruction
