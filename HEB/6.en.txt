Wherefore
of the teaching of baptisms
and this we will do
for `it is' impossible for those once enlightened
and did taste the good saying of God
and having fallen away
For earth
and that which is bearing thorns and briers `is' disapproved of
and we are persuaded
for God is not unrighteous to forget your work
and we desire each one of you the same diligence to shew
that ye may not become slothful
For to Abraham God
saying
and so
for men indeed do swear by the greater
in which God
that through two immutable things
which we have
whither a forerunner for us did enter -- Jesus
