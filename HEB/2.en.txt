Because of this it behoveth `us' more abundantly to take heed to the things heard
for if the word being spoken through messengers did become stedfast
how shall we escape
God also bearing joint-witness both with signs and wonders
For not to messengers did He subject the coming world
and one in a certain place did testify fully
Thou didst make him some little less than messengers
all things Thou didst put in subjection under his feet
and him who was made some little less than messengers we see -- Jesus -- because of the suffering of the death
For it was becoming to Him
for both he who is sanctifying and those sanctified `are' all of one
saying
and again
Seeing
and might deliver those
for
wherefore it did behove him in all things to be made like to the brethren
for in that he suffered
