And Ahab declareth to Jezebel all that Elijah did
and Jezebel sendeth a messenger unto Elijah
And he feareth
and he himself hath gone into the wilderness a day's Journey
And he lieth down and sleepeth under a certain retem-tree
and he looketh attentively
And the messenger of Jehovah turneth back a second time
and he riseth
And he cometh in there
And he saith
And He saith
and after the shaking a fire: -- not in the fire `is' Jehovah; and after the fire a voice still small;"
and it cometh to pass
And he saith
And Jehovah saith unto him
and Jehu son of Nimshi thou dost anoint for king over Israel
`And it hath been
and I have left in Israel seven thousand
And he goeth thence
and he forsaketh the oxen
And he turneth back from after him
