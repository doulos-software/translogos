And the days are many
and Elijah goeth to appear unto Ahab. And the famine is severe in Samaria
and Ahab calleth unto Obadiah
and it cometh to pass
and Ahab saith unto Obadiah
And they apportion to themselves the land
and Obadiah `is' in the way
And he saith to him
And he saith
Jehovah thy God liveth
and now
and it hath been
`Hath it not been declared to my lord that which I have done in Jezebel's slaying the prophets of Jehovah
and now thou art saying
And Elijah saith
And Obadiah goeth to meet Ahab
and it cometh to pass at Ahab's seeing Elijah
And he saith
and now
And Ahab sendeth among all the sons of Israel
and Elijah cometh nigh unto all the people
And Elijah saith unto the people
and let them give to us two bullocks
and ye have called in the name of your god
And Elijah saith to the prophets of Baal
And they take the bullock that `one' gave to them
And it cometh to pass
And they call with a loud voice
and it cometh to pass
And Elijah saith to all the people
and Elijah taketh twelve stones
and he buildeth with the stones an altar
And he arrangeth the wood
and he saith
and the water goeth round about the altar
And it cometh to pass
answer me
And there falleth a fire of Jehovah
And all the people see
And Elijah saith to them
And Elijah saith to Ahab
And Ahab goeth up to eat
and saith unto his young man
And it cometh to pass
And it cometh to pass
and the hand of Jehovah hath been on Elijah
