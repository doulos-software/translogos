And lo
and he calleth against the altar
And he hath given on that day a sign
And it cometh to pass
and the altar is rent
And the king answereth and saith unto the man of God
And the king speaketh unto the man of God
And the man of God saith unto the king
for so He commanded me by the word of Jehovah
And he goeth on in another way
And a certain aged prophet is dwelling in Beth-El
And their father saith unto them
And he saith unto his sons
and goeth after the man of God
And he saith unto him
And he saith
for a word `is' unto me by the word of Jehovah
And he saith to him
And he turneth back with him
And it cometh to pass -- they are sitting at the table -- and a word of Jehovah is unto the prophet who brought him back
and he calleth unto the man of God who came from Judah
and turnest back and dost eat bread and drink water in the place of which He said unto thee
And it cometh to pass
and he goeth
And lo
And the prophet who brought him back out of the way heareth and saith
And he speaketh unto his sons saying
And he goeth and findeth his carcase cast in the way
And the prophet taketh up the carcase of the man of God
and he placeth his carcase in his own grave
And it cometh to pass
for the word certainly cometh to pass that he called by the word of Jehovah concerning the altar which `is' Beth-El
After this thing Jeroboam hath not turned from his evil way
And in this thing is the sin of the house of Jeroboam
