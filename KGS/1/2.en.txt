And draw near do the days of David to die
`I am going in the way of all the earth
and kept the charge of Jehovah thy God
so that Jehovah doth establish His word which He spake unto me
`And also
and thou hast done according to thy wisdom
`And to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite thou dost do kindness
`And lo
and now
And David lieth down with his fathers
and the days that David hath reigned over Israel `are' forty years
And Solomon hath sat on the throne of David his father
and Adonijah son of Haggith cometh in unto Bath-Sheba
And he saith
And he saith
and now
And he saith
And Bath-Sheba saith
And Bath-Sheba cometh in unto king Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah
And she saith
And she saith
And king Solomon answereth and saith to his mother
And king Solomon sweareth by Jehovah
and now
And king Solomon sendeth by the hand of Benaiah son of Jehoiada
And to Abiathar the priest said the king
And Solomon casteth out Abiathar from being priest to Jehovah
And the report hath come unto Joab -- for Joab hath turned aside after Adonijah
And it is declared to king Solomon that Joab hath fled unto the tent of Jehovah
And Benaiah cometh in unto the tent of Jehovah
And the king saith to him
and Jehovah hath turned back his blood on his own head
yea
And Benaiah son of Jehoiada goeth up and falleth upon him
and the king putteth Benaiah son of Jehoiada in his stead over the host
And the king sendeth and calleth for Shimei
and it hath been
And Shimei saith to the king
And it cometh to pass
and Shimei riseth
And it is declared to Solomon that Shimei hath gone from Jerusalem to Gath
and the king sendeth and calleth for Shimei
and wherefore hast thou not kept the oath of Jehovah
And the king saith unto Shimei
and king Solomon `is' blessed
And the king chargeth Benaiah son of Jehoiada
