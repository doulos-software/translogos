And his own house hath Solomon built thirteen years
And he buildeth the house of the forest of Lebanon; a hundred cubits `is' its length
and `it is' covered with cedar above
And windows `are' in three rows
And all the openings and the side-posts `are' square -- windows; and sight `is' over-against sight three times."
And the porch of the pillars he hath made; fifty cubits its length
And the porch of the throne where he judgeth -- the porch of judgment -- he hath made
As to his house where he dwelleth
All these `are' of precious stone
And the foundation `is' of precious stone
and above `are' precious stone
and the great court round about `is' three rows of hewn work
And king Solomon sendeth and taketh Hiram out of Tyre --"
he `is' son of a woman
And he formeth the two pillars of brass; eighteen cubits `is' the height of the one pillar
And two chapiters he hath made to put on the tops of the pillars
Nets of net-work
And he maketh the pillars
And the chapiters that `are' on the top of the pillars `are' of lily-work in the porch
and the chapiters on the two pillars also above
And he raiseth up the pillars for the porch of the temple
and on the top of the pillars `is' lily-work; and the work of the pillars `is' completed."
And he maketh the molten sea
and knops beneath its brim round about are compassing it
It is standing on twelve oxen
And its thickness `is' an handbreadth
And he maketh the ten bases of brass; four by the cubit `is' the length of the one base
And this `is' the work of the base: they have borders
and on the borders that `are' between the joinings `are' lions
And four wheels of brass `are' to the one base
And its mouth within the chapiter and above `is' by the cubit
And the four wheels `are' under the borders
And the work of the wheels `is' as the work of the wheel of a chariot
And four shoulders `are' unto the four corners of the one base; out of the base `are' its shoulders."
And in the top of the base `is' the half of a cubit in the height all round about; and on the top of the base its spokes and its borders `are' of the same."
And he openeth on the tablets of its spokes
Thus he hath made the ten bases; one casting
And he maketh ten lavers of brass; forty baths doth the one laver contain
and he putteth the five bases on the right side of the house
And Hiram maketh the lavers
pillars two
and the pomegranates four hundred for the two nets
and the ten bases
and the one sea
and the pots
In the circuit of the Jordan hath the king cast them
And Solomon placeth the whole of the vessels; because of the very great abundance
And Solomon maketh all the vessels that `are' in the house of Jehovah: the altar of gold
and the candlesticks
and the basins
And it is complete -- all the work that king Solomon hath made `for' the house of Jehovah
