And king David `is' old
and his servants say to him
And they seek a fair young woman in all the border of Israel
and the young woman `is' very very fair
And Adonijah son of Haggith is lifting himself up
and his father hath not grieved him `all' his days
And his words are with Joab son of Zeruiah
and Zadok the priest
And Adonijah sacrificeth sheep and oxen and fatlings near the stone of Zoheleth
and Nathan the prophet
And Nathan speaketh unto Bath-Sheba
and now
go and enter in unto king David
Lo
And Bath-Sheba cometh in unto the king
and Bath-Sheba boweth and doth obeisance to the king
And she saith to him
and now
and he sacrificeth ox
And thou
and it hath been
And lo
and they declare to the king
And Nathan saith
for he hath gone down to-day
`And for me -- me
if from my lord the king this thing hath been
And king David answereth and saith
And the king sweareth and saith

And Bath-Sheba boweth -- face to the earth -- and doth obeisance to the king
And king David saith

and anointed him there hath Zadok the priest -- and Nathan the prophet -- for king over Israel
and ye have come up after him
And Benaiah son of Jehoiada answereth the king
as Jehovah hath been with my lord the king
And Zadok the priest goeth down
and Zadok the priest taketh the horn of oil out of the tent
And all the people come up after him

He is yet speaking
And Jonathan answereth and saith to Adonijah
and the king sendeth with him Zadok the priest
and they anoint him -- Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet -- for king in Gihon
`And also Solomon hath sat on the throne of the kingdom
and also the servants of the king have come into bless our lord king David
and also thus hath the king said
And they tremble
and Adonijah feareth because of Solomon
And it is declared to Solomon
And Solomon saith
And king Solomon sendeth
