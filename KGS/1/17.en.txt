And Elijah the Tishbite
And the word of Jehovah is unto him
`Go from this `place'; and thou hast turned for thee eastward
and it hath been
And he goeth and doth according to the word of Jehovah
and the ravens are bringing to him bread and flesh in the morning
And it cometh to pass
and the word of Jehovah is unto him
`Rise
And he riseth
And she goeth to bring `it'
And she saith
And Elijah saith unto her
for thus said Jehovah
And she goeth
the pitcher of meal was not consumed
And it cometh to pass
And she saith unto Elijah
And he saith unto her
and crieth unto Jehovah
And he stretcheth himself out on the lad three times
and Jehovah hearkeneth to the voice of Elijah
And Elijah taketh the lad
And the woman saith unto Elijah
