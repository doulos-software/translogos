And it cometh to pass
As to the house that king Solomon hath built for Jehovah
As to the porch on the front of the temple of the house
and he maketh for the house windows of narrow lights."
And he buildeth against the wall of the house a couch round about
The lowest couch
And the house
The opening of the middle side `is' at the right shoulder of the house
And he buildeth the house
And he buildeth the couch against all the house
And the word of Jehovah is unto Solomon
`This house that thou art building -- if thou dost walk in My statutes
and have tabernacled in the midst of the sons of Israel
And Solomon buildeth the house and completeth it;"
and he buildeth the walls of the house within with beams of cedar
And he buildeth the twenty cubits on the sides of the house with ribs of cedar
And forty by the cubit was the house
And the cedar for the house within `is' carvings of knobs and openings of flowers; the whole `is' cedar
And the oracle in the midst of the house within he hath prepared
And before the oracle `is' twenty cubits in length
And Solomon overlayeth the house within with gold refined
And the whole of the house he hath overlaid with gold
And he maketh within the oracle two cherubs
and five cubits `is' the one wing of the cherub
and ten by the cubit `is' the second cherub
the height of the one cherub `is' ten by the cubit
and he setteth the cherubs in the midst of the inner house
and he overlayeth the cherubs with gold
and all the walls of the house round about he hath carved with openings of carvings
And the floor of the house he hath overlaid with gold
as to the opening of the oracle
And the two doors `are' of the oil-tree
And so he hath made for the opening of the temple
And the two doors `are' of fir-tree
And he hath carved cherubs
And he buildeth the inner court
In the fourth year hath the house of Jehovah been founded
and in the eleventh year
