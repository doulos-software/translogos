And the queen of Sheba is hearing of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Jehovah
and she cometh to Jerusalem
And Solomon declareth to her all her matters -- there hath not been a thing hid from the king that he hath not declared to her."
And the queen of Sheba seeth all the wisdom of Solomon
and the food of his table
And she saith unto the king
and I gave no credence to the words till that I have come
O the happiness of thy men
Jehovah thy God is blessed who delighted in thee
And she giveth to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold
And also
and the king maketh the almug-trees a support for the house of Jehovah
And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire that she asked
And the weight of the gold that hath come to Solomon in one year is six hundred sixty and six talents of gold
apart from `that of' the tourists
And king Solomon maketh two hundred targets of alloyed gold -- six hundred of gold go up on the one target;"
and three hundred shields of alloyed gold -- three pounds of gold go up on the one shield; and the king putteth them `in' the house of the forest of Lebanon."
And the king maketh a great throne of ivory
six steps hath the throne
and twelve lions are standing there on the six steps
And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon `are' of gold
for a navy of Tarshish hath the king at sea with a navy of Hiram; once in three years cometh the navy of Tarshish
And king Solomon is greater than any of the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom
and all the earth is seeking the presence of Solomon
and they are bringing each his present
And Solomon gathereth chariots
And the king maketh the silver in Jerusalem as stones
And the outgoing of the horses that king Solomon hath `is' from Egypt
and a chariot cometh up and cometh out of Egypt for six hundred silverlings
