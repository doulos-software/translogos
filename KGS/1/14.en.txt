At that time was Abijah son of Jeroboam sick
and Jeroboam saith to his wife
and thou hast taken in thy hand ten loaves
And the wife of Jeroboam doth so
And Jehovah said unto Ahijah
And it cometh to pass
Go
and rend the kingdom from the house of David
and thou dost evil above all who have been before thee
`Therefore
him who dieth of Jeroboam in a city do the dogs eat
`And thou
and all Israel have mourned for him
`And Jehovah hath raised up for Him a king over Israel who cutteth off the house of Jeroboam this day -- and what? -- even now!"
And Jehovah hath smitten Israel as the reed is moved by the waters
and He giveth up Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam that he sinned
And the wife of Jeroboam riseth
and they bury him
And the rest of the matters of Jeroboam
And the days that Jeroboam reigned `are' twenty and two years
And Rehoboam son of Solomon hath reigned in Judah; a son of forty and one years `is' Rehoboam in his reigning
And Judah doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
And they build -- also they -- for themselves high places
and also a whoremonger hath been in the land; they have done according to all the abominations of the nations that Jehovah dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel."
And it cometh to pass
and he taketh the treasures of the house of Jehovah
And king Rehoboam maketh in their stead shields of brass
and it cometh to pass
And the rest of the matters of Rehoboam
And war hath been between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days;"
and Rehoboam lieth with his fathers
