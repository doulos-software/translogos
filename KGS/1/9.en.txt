And it cometh to pass
that Jehovah appeareth unto Solomon a second time
and Jehovah saith unto him
`And thou -- if thou dost walk before Me as David thy father walked
then I have established the throne of thy kingdom over Israel -- to the age
`If ye at all turn back -- you and your sons -- from after Me
then I have cut off Israel from the face of the ground that I have given to them
as to this house
and they have said
And it cometh to pass
Hiram king of Tyre hath assisted Solomon with cedar-trees
And Hiram cometh out from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon hath given to him
and he saith
And Hiram sendeth to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold."
And this `is' the matter of the tribute that king Solomon hath lifted up
(Pharaoh king of Egypt hath gone up and doth capture Gezer
And Solomon buildeth Gezer
and Baalath
and all the cities of stores that king Solomon hath
The whole of the people that is left of the Amorite
their sons who are left behind them in the land
And out of the sons of Israel Solomon hath not appointed a servant
These `are' the heads of the officers who `are' over the work of Solomon
Only
And Solomon caused to ascend
And a navy hath king Solomon made in Ezion-Geber
And Hiram sendeth in the navy his servants
and they come in to Ophir and take thence gold
