And in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam son of Nebat
three years he hath reigned in Jerusalem
and he walketh in all the sins of his father
but for David's sake hath Jehovah his God given to him a lamp in Jerusalem
in that David did that which `is' right in the eyes of Jehovah
and war hath been between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life."
And the rest of the matters of Abijam
and Abijam lieth with his fathers
And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned hath Asa over Judah
and forty and one years he hath reigned in Jerusalem
And Asa doth that which `is' right in the eyes of Jehovah
and removeth the whoremongers out of the land
and also Maachah his mother -- he turneth her aside from being mistress
and the high places have not turned aside; only
and he bringeth in the sanctified things of his father
And war hath been between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days
and Baasha king of Israel goeth up against Judah
And Asa taketh all the silver and the gold that are left in the treasures of the house of Jehovah
`A covenant `is' between me and thee
And Ben-Hadad hearkeneth unto king Asa
and it cometh to pass at Baasha's hearing
And king Asa hath summoned all Judah -- there is none exempt -- and they lift up the stones of Ramah
And the rest of all the matters of Asa
and Asa lieth with his fathers
And Nadab son of Jeroboam hath reigned over Israel
and doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
And conspire against him doth Baasha son of Ahijah
yea
And it cometh to pass
because of the sins of Jeroboam that he sinned
And the rest of the matters of Nadab
And war hath been between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days."
In the third year of Asa king of Judah reigned hath Baasha son of Ahijah over all Israel in Tirzah
and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
