And king Solomon is king over all Israel
and these `are' the heads whom he hath: Azariah son of Zadok `is' the priest;"
Elihoreph and Ahiah sons of Shisha `are' scribes; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud `is' remembrancer;"
and Benaiah son of Jehoiada `is' over the host; and Zadok and Abiathar `are' priests;"
and Azariah son of Nathan `is' over the officers; and Zabud son of Nathan `is' minister
And Ahishar `is' over the household
And Solomon hath twelve officers over all Israel
and these `are' their names: Ben-Hur in the hill-country of Ephraim;"
Ben-Dekar in Makaz
Ben-Hesed `is' in Aruboth
Ben-Abinadab `hath' all the elevation of Dor
Baana Ben-Ahilud `hath' Taanach and Megiddo
Ben-Geber
Ahinadab son of Iddo `hath' Mahanaim."
Ahimaaz `is' in Naphtali; he also hath taken Basemath daughter of Solomon for a wife."
Baanah Ben-Hushai `is' in Asher
Jehoshaphat Ben-Paruah `is' in Issachar."
Shimei Ben-Elah `is' in Benjamin."
Geber Ben-Uri `is' in the land of Gilead
Judah and Israel `are' many
And Solomon hath been ruling over all the kingdoms
And the provision of Solomon for one day is thirty cors of flour
ten fat oxen
for he is ruling over all beyond the river
And Judah dwelleth -- and Israel -- in confidence
And Solomon hath forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots
And these officers have sustained king Solomon and every one drawing near unto the table of king Solomon
And the barley and the straw
And God giveth wisdom to Solomon
and the wisdom of Solomon is greater than the wisdom of any of the sons of the east
and he is wiser than all men
And he speaketh three thousand similes
and he speaketh concerning the trees
and there come out of all the peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon
