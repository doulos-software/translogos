And it cometh to pass
and Ahab speaketh unto Naboth
And Naboth saith unto Ahab
and Ahab cometh in unto his house
And Jezebel his wife cometh in unto him
And he saith unto her
And Jezebel his wife saith unto him
And she writeth letters in the name of Ahab
and she writeth in the letters
and cause two men -- sons of worthlessness -- to sit over-against him
And the men of his city
they have proclaimed a fast
and two men -- sons of worthlessness -- come in
and they send unto Jezebel
And it cometh to pass
And it cometh to pass
And the word of Jehovah is unto Elijah the Tishbite
`Rise
and thou hast spoken unto him
And Ahab saith unto Elijah
lo
and given up thy house like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat
`And also of Jezebel hath Jehovah spoken
him who dieth of Ahab in a city do the dogs eat
surely there hath none been like Ahab
and he doth very abominably to go after the idols
And it cometh to pass
And the word of Jehovah is unto Elijah the Tishbite
`Hast thou seen that Ahab hath been humbled before Me? because that he hath been humbled before Me
