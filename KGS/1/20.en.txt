And Ben-Hadad king of Aram hath gathered all his force
and sendeth messengers unto Ahab king of Israel
and saith to him
And the king of Israel answereth and saith
And the messengers turn back and say
for if
And the king of Israel calleth to all the elders of the land
And all the elders and all the people say unto him
And he saith to the messengers of Ben-Hadad
And Ben-Hadad sendeth unto him
And the king of Israel answereth and saith
And it cometh to pass at the hearing of this word -- and he is drinking
And lo
And Ahab saith
And he inspecteth the young men of the heads of the provinces
and they go out at noon
And the young men of the heads of the provinces go out at the first
And he saith
And these have gone out of the city -- the young men of the heads of the provinces -- and the force that `is' after them
and smite each his man
and the king of Israel goeth out
And the prophet cometh nigh unto the king of Israel
And the servants of the king of Aram said unto him
`And this thing do thou: turn aside the kings each out of his place
and thou
And it cometh to pass at the turn of the year
and the sons of Israel have been inspected
And there cometh nigh a man of God
And they encamp one over-against another seven days
And those left flee to Aphek
And his servants say unto him
And they gird sackcloth on their loins
And the men observe diligently
And he saith unto him
And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour by the word of Jehovah
and he saith to him
And he findeth another man
and the prophet goeth and standeth for the king on the way
And it cometh to pass -- the king is passing by -- that he hath cried unto the king
and it cometh to pass
And he hasteth and turneth aside the ashes from off his eyes
and he saith unto him
and the king of Israel goeth unto his house
