And Hiram king of Tyre sendeth his servants unto Solomon
and Solomon sendeth unto Hiram
`Thou hast known David my father
`And now
and lo
`And now
And it cometh to pass at Hiram's hearing the words of Solomon
And Hiram sendeth unto Solomon
my servants bring down from Lebanon to the sea
And Hiram is giving to Solomon cedar-trees
and Solomon hath given to Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat
And Jehovah hath given wisdom to Solomon as He spake to him
And king Solomon lifteth up a tribute out of all Israel
and he sendeth them to Lebanon
And king Solomon hath seventy thousand bearing burdens
apart from the heads of the officers of Solomon
And the king commandeth
and the builders of Solomon
