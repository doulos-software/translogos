And Rehoboam goeth to Shechem
And it cometh to pass
that they send and call for him; and they come -- Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel -- and speak unto Rehoboam
`Thy father made hard our yoke
And he saith unto them
And king Rehoboam consulteth with the elders who have been standing in the presence of Solomon his father
And they speak unto him
And he forsaketh the counsel of the elders which they counselled him
and he saith unto them
And they speak unto him -- the lads who had grown up with him -- saying
and now
And they come -- Jeroboam and all the people -- unto Rehoboam
And the king answereth the people sharply
and speaketh unto them
and the king hearkened not unto the people
And all Israel see that the king hath not hearkened unto them
As to the sons of Israel
And king Rehoboam sendeth Adoram who `is' over the tribute
and Israel transgresseth against the house of David unto this day."
And it cometh to pass
And Rehoboam cometh to Jerusalem
And the word of God is unto Shemaiah a man of God
`Speak unto Rehoboam son of Solomon
Thus said Jehovah
And Jeroboam buildeth Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim
and Jeroboam saith in his heart
if this people go up to make sacrifices in the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem
And the king taketh counsel
And he setteth the one in Beth-El
and this thing becometh a sin
And he maketh the house of high places
and Jeroboam maketh a festival in the eighth month
And he offereth up on the altar that he made in Beth-El
