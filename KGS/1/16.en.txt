And a word of Jehovah is unto Jehu son of Hanani
`Because that I have raised thee up out of the dust
lo
him who dieth of Baasha in a city do the dogs eat
And the rest of the matters of Baasha
And Baasha lieth with his fathers
And also by the hand of Jehu son of Hanani the prophet a word of Jehovah hath been concerning Baasha
In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah reigned hath Elah son of Baasha over Israel in Tirzah
and conspire against him doth his servant Zimri (head of the half of the chariots) and he `is' in Tirzah drinking -- a drunkard in the house of Arza
And Zimri cometh in and smiteth him
and it cometh to pass in his reigning
And Zimri destroyeth the whole house of Baasha
concerning all the sins of Baasha
And the rest of the matters of Elah
In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah
and the people who are encamping hear
And Omri goeth up
And it cometh to pass
for his sins that he sinned
and the rest of the matters of Zimri
Then are the sons of Israel parted into halves; half of the people hath been after Tibni son of Ginath to cause him to reign
and stronger are the people that are after Omri than the people that are after Tibni son of Ginath
In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah reigned hath Omri over Israel twelve years; in Tirzah he hath reigned six years
and he buyeth the mount Samaria from Shemer
And Omri doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
and walketh in all the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat
And the rest of the matters of Omri that he did
And Omri lieth with his fathers
And Ahab son of Omri hath reigned over Israel in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah
and Ahab son of Omri doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah above all who `are' before him."
And it cometh to pass -- hath it been light his walking in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat? -- then he taketh a wife
and raiseth up an altar for Baal
and Ahab maketh the shrine
In his days hath Hiel the Beth-Elite built Jericho; in Abiram his first-born he laid its foundation
