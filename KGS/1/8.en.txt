Then doth Solomon assemble the elders of Israel
and all the men of Israel are assembled unto king Solomon
And all the elders of Israel come in
and bring up the ark of Jehovah
And king Solomon and all the company of Israel who are met unto him `are' with him before the ark
And the priests bring in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place
for the cherubs are spreading forth two wings unto the place of the ark
and they lengthen the staves
There is nothing in the ark
And it cometh to pass
and the priests have not been able to stand to minister because of the cloud
Then said Solomon
I have surely built a house of habitation for Thee; a fixed place for Thine abiding to the ages.'"
And the king turneth round his face
And he saith
From the day that I brought out My people
`And it is with the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah
and Jehovah saith unto David my father
only
`And Jehovah doth establish His word which He spake
and set there a place for the ark
And Solomon standeth before the altar of Jehovah
and saith
who hast kept for Thy servant David my father that which Thou spakest to him; yea
`And now
`And now
But
`Then thou hast turned unto the prayer of Thy servant
for Thine eyes being open towards this house night and day
`Then Thou hast hearkened unto the supplication of Thy servant
that which a man sinneth against his neighbour
then Thou dost hear in the heavens
`In Thy people Israel being smitten before an enemy
then thou dost hear in the heavens
`In the heavens being restrained
then Thou dost hear in the heavens
`Famine -- when it is in the land; pestilence -- when it is; blasting
any prayer
then Thou dost hear in the heavens
so that they fear Thee all the days that they are living on the face of the ground that Thou hast given to our fathers."
`And also
(for they hear of Thy great name
Thou dost hear in the heavens
`When Thy people doth go out to battle against its enemy
then Thou hast heard in the heavens their prayer and their supplication
`When they sin against Thee (for there is not a man who sinneth not)
and they have turned `it' back unto their heart in the land whither they have been taken captive
yea
`Then Thou hast heard in the heavens
and hast forgiven Thy people who have sinned against Thee
(for Thy people and Thy inheritance `are' they
for Thine eyes being open unto the supplication of Thy servant
for Thou hast separated them to Thyself for an inheritance
And it cometh to pass
and he standeth and blesseth all the assembly of Israel `with' a loud voice
`Blessed `is' Jehovah who hath given rest to His people Israel
`Jehovah our God is with us as He hath been with our fathers; He doth not forsake us nor leave us;"
to incline our heart unto Himself
and these my words with which I have made supplication before Jehovah
for all the peoples of the earth knowing that Jehovah
and your heart hath been perfect with Jehovah our God
And the king and all Israel with him are sacrificing a sacrifice before Jehovah;"
and Solomon sacrificeth the sacrifice of peace-offerings
On that day hath the king sanctified the middle of the court that `is' before the house of Jehovah
And Solomon maketh
On the eighth day he hath sent the people away
