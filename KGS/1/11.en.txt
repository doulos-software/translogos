And king Solomon hath loved many strange women
of the nations of which Jehovah said unto the sons of Israel
And he hath women
And it cometh to pass
And Solomon goeth after Ashtoreth god`dess' of the Zidonians
and Solomon doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
Then doth Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab
and so he hath done for all his strange women
And Jehovah sheweth Himself angry with Solomon
and given a charge unto him concerning this thing
and Jehovah saith to Solomon
`Only
only all the kingdom I do not rend away; one tribe I give to thy son
And Jehovah raiseth up an adversary to Solomon
and it cometh to pass
for six months did Joab abide there
and Hadad fleeth
and they rise out of Midian
And Hadad findeth grace in the eyes of Pharaoh exceedingly
and the sister of Tahpenes beareth to him Genubath his son
And Hadad hath heard in Egypt that David hath lain with his fathers
And Pharaoh saith to him
And God raiseth to him an adversary
and gathereth unto himself men
and he is an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon
And Jeroboam son of Nebat
and this `is' the thing `for' which he lifted up a hand against the king: Solomon built Millo -- he shut up the breach of the city of David his father
and the man Jeroboam `is' mighty in valour
And it cometh to pass
and Ahijah layeth hold on the new garment that `is' on him
and saith to Jeroboam
and the one tribe he hath for My servant David's sake
`Because they have forsaken Me
`And I do not take the whole of the kingdom out of his hand
and I have taken the kingdom out of the hand of his son
and to his son I give one tribe
`And thee I take
and it hath been
and I humble the seed of David for this; only
And Solomon seeketh to put Jeroboam to death
And the rest of the matters of Solomon
And the days that Solomon hath reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel `are' forty years
and Solomon lieth with his fathers
