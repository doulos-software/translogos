And Solomon joineth in marriage with Pharaoh king of Egypt
Only
And Solomon loveth Jehovah
and the king goeth to Gibeon
In Gibeon hath Jehovah appeared unto Solomon
And Solomon saith
And now
and Thy servant `is' in the midst of thy people
and Thou hast given to Thy servant an understanding heart
And the thing is good in the eyes of the Lord
and God saith unto him
lo
and also
and if thou dost walk in My ways to keep My statutes
And Solomon awaketh
then come in do two women
and the one woman saith
and it cometh to pass on the third day of my bringing forth
And the son of this woman dieth at night
and she riseth in the middle of the night
and I rise in the morning to suckle my son
And the other woman saith
And the king saith
And the king saith
and the king saith
And the woman whose son `is' the living one saith unto the king (for her bowels yearned over her son)
And the king answereth and saith
And all Israel hear of the judgment that the king hath judged
