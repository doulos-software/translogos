In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah reigned hath Hoshea son of Elah in Samaria
and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
against him came up Shalmaneser king of Asshur
And the king of Asshur findeth in Hoshea a conspiracy
And the king of Asshur goeth up into all the land
in the ninth year of Hoshea hath the king of Asshur captured Samaria
And it cometh to pass
and walk in the statutes of the nations that Jehovah dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel
and the sons of Israel do covertly things that `are' not right against Jehovah their God
and set up for them standing-pillars and shrines on every high height
and make perfume there in all high places
and serve the idols
And Jehovah testifieth against Israel
and they have not hearkened
and reject His statutes and His covenant that He made with their fathers
And they forsake all the commands of Jehovah their God
and cause their sons and their daughters to pass over through fire
That Jehovah sheweth himself very angry against Israel
Also Judah hath not kept the commands of Jehovah their God
And Jehovah kicketh against all the seed of Israel
for He hath rent Israel from the house of David
and the sons of Israel walk in all the sins of Jeroboam that he did
till that Jehovah hath turned Israel aside from His presence
And the king of Asshur bringeth in from Babylon and from Cutha
and it cometh to pass
And they speak to the king of Asshur
And the king of Asshur commandeth
And one of the priests whom they removed from Samaria cometh in
and they are making each nation its gods
And the men of Babylon have made Succoth-Benoth
and the Avites have made Nibhaz and Tartak
And they are fearing Jehovah
Jehovah they are fearing
Unto this day they are doing according to the former customs -- they are not fearing Jehovah
and Jehovah maketh with them a covenant
but Jehovah who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power
and the statutes
and the covenant that I have made with you ye do not forget
but Jehovah your God ye do fear
and they have not hearkened
and these nations are fearing Jehovah
