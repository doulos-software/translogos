In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah reigned hath Ahaz son of Jotham king of Judah."
A son of twenty years `is' Ahaz in his reigning
and he walketh in the way of the kings of Israel
and he sacrificeth and maketh perfume in high places
Then doth Rezin king of Aram go up
At that time hath Rezin king of Aram brought back Elath to Aram
And Ahaz sendeth messengers unto Tiglath-Pileser king of Asshur
And Ahaz taketh the silver and the gold that is found in the house of Jehovah
And hearken unto him doth the king of Asshur
And king Ahaz goeth to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Asshur `at' Damascus
and Urijah the priest buildeth the altar according to all that king Ahaz hath sent from Damascus; so did Urijah the priest till the coming in of king Ahaz from Damascus."
And the king cometh in from Damascus
and perfumeth his burnt-offering
As to the altar of brass that `is' before Jehovah -- he bringeth `it' near from the front of the house
And king Ahaz commandeth him -- Urijah the priest -- saying
And Urijah the priest doth according to all that king Ahaz commanded."
And king Ahaz cutteth off the borders of the bases
And the covered place for the sabbath that they built in the house
And the rest of the matters of Ahaz that he did
And Ahaz lieth with his fathers
