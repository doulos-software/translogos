And Moab transgresseth against Israel after the death of Ahab
and Ahaziah falleth through the lattice in his upper chamber that `is' in Samaria
And a messenger of Jehovah hath spoken unto Elijah the Tishbite
and therefore
And the messengers turn back unto him
And they say unto him
And he saith unto them
And they say unto him
And he sendeth unto him a head of fifty and his fifty
And Elijah answereth and speaketh unto the head of the fifty
And he turneth and sendeth unto him another head of fifty and his fifty
And Elijah answereth and speaketh unto them
And he turneth and sendeth a third head of fifty and his fifty
Lo
And a messenger of Jehovah speaketh unto Elijah
and speaketh unto him
And he dieth
And the rest of the matters of Ahaziah that he did
