In those days hath Hezekiah been sick unto death
And he turneth round his face unto the wall
`I pray Thee
And it cometh to pass -- Isaiah hath not gone out to the middle court -- that the word of Jehovah hath been unto him
`Turn back
and I have added to thy days fifteen years
And Isaiah saith
And Hezekiah saith unto Isaiah
And Isaiah saith
And Hezekiah saith
And Isaiah the prophet calleth unto Jehovah
At that time hath Berodach-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah
and Hezekiah hearkeneth unto them
And Isaiah the prophet cometh in unto king Hezekiah
And he saith
And Isaiah saith unto Hezekiah
Lo
and of thy sons who go out from thee
And Hezekiah saith unto Isaiah
And the rest of the matters of Hezekiah
And Hezekiah lieth with his fathers
