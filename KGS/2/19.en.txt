And it cometh to pass
and sendeth Eliakim
and they say unto him
`It may be Jehovah thy God doth hear all the words of the chief of the butlers with which the king of Asshur his lord hath sent him to reproach the living God
And the servants of king Hezekiah come in unto Isaiah
and Isaiah saith to them
Lo
And the chief of the butlers turneth back and findeth the king of Asshur fighting against Libnah
And he heareth concerning Tirhakah king of Cush
`Thus do ye speak unto Hezekiah king of Judah
Lo
did the gods of the nations deliver them whom my fathers destroyed -- Gozan
Where `is' the king of Hamath
And Hezekiah taketh the letters out of the hand of the messengers
And Hezekiah prayeth before Jehovah
Incline
`Truly
and have put their gods into fire
And now
And Isaiah son of Amoz sendeth unto Hezekiah
this `is' the word that Jehovah spake concerning him: `Trampled on thee -- laughed at thee
Whom hast thou reproached and reviled? And against whom lifted up a voice? Yea
By the hand of thy messengers Thou hast reproached the Lord
I have digged
Hast thou not heard from afar
And their inhabitants `are' feeble-handed
And thy sitting down
Because of thine anger towards Me
And this to thee `is' the sign
And it hath continued -- The escaped of the house of Judah That hath been left -- to take root beneath
For from Jerusalem goeth out a remnant
Therefore
In the way that he cometh in -- In it he turneth back
And I have covered over this city
And it cometh to pass
And Sennacherib king of Asshur journeyeth
and it cometh to pass
