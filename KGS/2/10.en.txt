And Ahab hath seventy sons in Samaria
`And now
and ye have seen the best and the uprightest of the sons of your lord
And they fear very greatly
And he who `is' over the house
And he writeth unto them a letter a second time
And it cometh to pass
and the messenger cometh in
And it cometh to pass in the morning
Know ye now
And Jehu smiteth all those left to the house of Ahab in Jezreel
And he riseth
and Jehu hath found the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah
And he saith
And he goeth thence
and saith
And he cometh in to Samaria
And Jehu gathereth the whole of the people
and now
And Jehu saith
And Jehu sendeth into all Israel
And he saith to him who `is' over the wardrobe
And Jehu goeth in
And they come in to make sacrifices and burnt-offerings
And it cometh to pass at his finishing to make the burnt-offering
and bring out the standing-pillars of the house of Baal
and break down the standing-pillar of Baal
And Jehu destroyeth Baal out of Israel
only -- the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat
And Jehovah saith unto Jehu
And Jehu hath not taken heed to walk in the law of Jehovah
In those days hath Jehovah begun to cut off `some' in Israel
from the Jordan
And the rest of the matters of Jehu
And Jehu lieth with his fathers
And the days that Jehu hath reigned over Israel `are' twenty and eight years
