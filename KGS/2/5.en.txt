And Naaman
And the Aramaeans have gone out `by' troops
and she saith unto her mistress
And `one' goeth in and declareth to his lord
And the king of Aram saith
And he bringeth in the letter unto the king of Israel
And it cometh to pass
And it cometh to pass
And Naaman cometh
and Elisha sendeth unto him a messenger
And Naaman is wroth
Are not Abana and Pharpar
And his servants come nigh
And he goeth down and dippeth in Jordan seven times
And he turneth back unto the man of God
And he saith
And Naaman saith
For this thing Jehovah be propitious to thy servant
And he saith to him
And Gehazi
And Gehazi pursueth after Naaman
And he saith
And Naaman saith
and he cometh in unto the high place
And he hath come in
And he saith unto him
yea
