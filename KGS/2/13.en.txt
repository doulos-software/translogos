In the twenty and third year of Joash son of Ahaziah king of Judah
and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
and the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel
And Jehoahaz appeaseth the face of Jehovah
and Jehovah giveth to Israel a saviour
only
for he left not to Jehoahaz of the people except fifty horsemen
And the rest of the matters of Jehoahaz
And Jehoahaz lieth with his fathers
In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah reigned hath Jehoash son of Jehoahaz over Israel
and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
And the rest of the matters of Joash
And Joash lieth with his fathers
And Elisha hath been sick with his sickness in which he dieth
And Elisha saith to him
And he saith to the king of Israel
and saith
And he saith
And the man of God is wroth against him
And Elisha dieth
and it cometh to pass
And Hazael king of Aram hath oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz
and Jehovah doth favour them
And Hazael king of Aram dieth
and Jehoash son of Jehoahaz turneth and taketh the cities out of the hand of Ben-Hadad son of Hazael that he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father in war; three times hath Joash smitten him
