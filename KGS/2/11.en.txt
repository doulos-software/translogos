And Athaliah `is' mother of Ahaziah
and Jehosheba daughter of king Joram
and he is with her
And in the seventh year hath Jehoiada sent and taketh the heads of the hundreds
and commandeth them
and the third `is' at the gate of Sur
and two parts of you
and ye have compassed the king round about
And the heads of the hundreds do according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded
and the priest giveth to the heads of the hundreds the spears and the shields that king David had
And the runners stand
and he bringeth out the son of the king
And Athaliah heareth the voice of the runners `and' of the people
and looketh
And Jehoiada the priest commandeth the heads of the hundreds
And they make for her sides
And Jehoiada maketh the covenant between Jehovah and the king and the people
And all the people of the land go in to the house of Baal
and taketh the heads of the hundreds
And all the people of the land rejoice
a son of seven years is Jehoash in his reigning."
