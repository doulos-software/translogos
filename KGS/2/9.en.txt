And Elisha the prophet hath called to one of the sons of the prophets
and thou hast gone in there
and taken the vial of oil
And the young man goeth -- the young man the prophet -- to Ramoth-Gilead
and cometh in
And he riseth and cometh in to the house
and thou hast smitten the house of Ahab thy lord
and perished hath all the house of Ahab
and I have given up the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat
and Jezebel do the dogs eat in the portion of Jezreel
And Jehu hath gone out unto the servants of his lord
And they say
And they haste and take each his garment
And Jehu son of Jehoshaphat
and king Joram turneth back to be healed in Jezreel
And Jehu rideth
And the watchman is standing on the tower in Jezreel
and the rider on the horse goeth to meet him
And he sendeth a second rider on a horse
And the watchman declareth
And Jehoram saith
And it cometh to pass
And Jehoram turneth his hands
And Jehu hath filled his hand with a bow
And `Jehu' saith unto Bidkar his captain
Have I not the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons seen yesternight -- the affirmation of Jehovah -- yea
And Ahaziah king of Judah hath seen
and his servants carry him in a chariot to Jerusalem
And in the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab reign did Ahaziah over Judah."
And Jehu cometh in to Jezreel
And Jehu hath come into the gate
And he lifteth up his face unto the window
And he saith
And he cometh in
And they go to bury her
And they turn back
and the carcase of Jezebel hath been as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel
