And the king sendeth
and the king goeth up to the house of Jehovah
And the king standeth by the pillar
And the king commandeth Hilkiah the high priest
And he hath caused to cease the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah have appointed
And he bringeth out the shrine from the house of Jehovah to the outside of Jerusalem
And he breaketh down the houses of the whoremongers that `are' in the house of Jehovah
And he bringeth in all the priests out of the cities of Judah
only
And he hath defiled Topheth
And he causeth to cease the horses that the kings of Judah have given to the sun from the entering in of the house of Jehovah
And the altars that `are' on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz
And the high places that `are' on the front of Jerusalem
And he hath broken in pieces the standing-pillars
and also the altar that `is' in Beth-El
And Josiah turneth
And he saith
And he saith
And also all the houses of the high places that `are' in the cities of Samaria
And he slayeth all the priests of the high places who `are' there by the altars
And the king commandeth the whole of the people
Surely there hath not been made like this passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel
but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah
And also
And like him there hath not been before him a king who turned back unto Jehovah with all his heart
Only
and Jehovah saith
And the rest of the matters of Josiah
In his days hath Pharaoh-Nechoh king of Egypt come up against the king of Asshur
And his servants cause him to ride dying from Megiddo
A son of twenty and three years `is' Jehoahaz in his reigning
and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
and Pharaoh-Nechoh bindeth him in Riblah
And Pharaoh-Nechoh causeth Eliakim son of Josiah to reign instead of Josiah his father
And the silver and the gold hath Jehoiakim given to Pharaoh; only he valued the land to give the silver by the command of Pharaoh; from each
A son of twenty and five years `is' Jehoiakim in his reigning
and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
