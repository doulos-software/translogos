A son of eight years `is' Josiah in his reigning
and he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah
And it cometh to pass
`Go up unto Hilkiah the high priest
and they give it into the hand of the doers of the work
to artificers
only
And Hilkiah the high priest saith unto Shaphan the scribe
And Shaphan the scribe cometh in unto the king
And Shaphan the scribe declareth to the king
And it cometh to pass
and the king commandeth Hilkiah the priest
`Go
And Hilkiah the priest goeth
And she saith unto them
Thus said Jehovah
because that they have forsaken Me
`And unto the king of Judah
because thy heart `is' tender
therefore
