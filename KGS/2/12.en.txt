In the seventh year of Jehu reigned hath Jehoash
and Jehoash doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah all his days in which Jehoiada the priest directed him
only
And Jehoash saith unto the priests
do the priests take to them
And it cometh to pass
and king Jehoash calleth to Jehoiada the priest
And the priests consent not to receive money from the people
and Jehoiada the priest taketh a chest
And it cometh to pass
and have given the weighed money into the hands of those doing the work
and to those `repairing' the wall
Only
for to those doing the work they give it
and they do not reckon with the men into whose hand they give the money to give to those doing the work
The money of a trespass-offering
Then go up doth Hazael king of Aram
and Jehoash king of Judah taketh all the sanctified things that Jehoshaphat
And the rest of the matters of Joash
And his servants rise
yea
