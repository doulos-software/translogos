In his days hath Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon come up
and Jehovah sendeth against him the troops of the Chaldeans
only
and also the innocent blood that he hath shed
And the rest of the matters of Jehoiakim
And Jehoiakim lieth with his fathers
And the king of Egypt hath not added any more to go out from his own land
A son of eighteen years `is' Jehoiachin in his reigning
and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
At that time come up have servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem
and Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon cometh against the city
and Jehoiachin king of Judah goeth out unto the king of Babylon
and bringeth out thence all the treasures of the house of Jehovah
And he hath removed all Jerusalem
And he removeth Jehoiachin to Babylon
and all the men of valour seven thousand
And the king of Babylon causeth Mattaniah his father's brother to reign in his stead
A son of twenty and one years `is' Zedekiah in his reigning
and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah according to all that Jehoiakim did
for
