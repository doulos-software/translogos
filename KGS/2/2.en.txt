And it cometh to pass
and Elijah saith unto Elisha
And sons of the prophets who `are' in Beth-El come out unto Elisha
And Elijah saith to him
And sons of the prophets who `are' in Jericho come nigh unto Elisha
And Elijah saith to him
-- and fifty men of the sons of the prophets have gone on
And Elijah taketh his robe
And it cometh to pass
and he saith
And it cometh to pass
And Elisha is seeing
And he taketh up the robe of Elijah
and he taketh the robe of Elijah that fell from off him
And they see him -- the sons of the prophets who `are' in Jericho -- over-against
and say unto him
And they press upon him
and they turn back unto him -- and he is abiding in Jericho -- and he saith unto them
And the men of the city say unto Elisha
And he saith
and he goeth out unto the source of the waters
And the waters are healed unto this day
And he goeth up thence to Beth-El
And he looketh behind him
And he goeth thence unto the hill of Carmel
