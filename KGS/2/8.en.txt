And Elisha spake unto the woman whose son he had revived
And the woman riseth
And it cometh to pass
And the king is speaking unto Gehazi
And it cometh to pass
And the king asketh at the woman
And Elisha cometh in to Damascus
And the king saith unto Hazael
And Hazael goeth to meet him
And Elisha saith unto him
And he setteth his face
And Hazael saith
And Hazael saith
And he goeth from Elisha
And it cometh to pass on the morrow
And in the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel -- and Jehoshaphat `is' king of Judah -- hath Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah reigned;"
a son of thirty and two years was he in his reigning
And he walketh in the way of the kings of Israel
and Jehovah was not willing to destroy Judah
In his days hath Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah
and Joram passeth over to Zair
and Edom revolteth from under the hand of Judah till this day; then doth Libnah revolt at that time."
And the rest of the matters of Joram
And Joram lieth with his fathers
In the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel reigned hath Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah;"
a son of twenty and two years `is' Ahaziah in his reigning
and he walketh in the way of the house of Ahab
And he goeth with Joram son of Ahab to battle with Hazael king of Aram in Ramoth-Gilead
and Joram the king turneth back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds with which the Arameans smite him in Ramah
