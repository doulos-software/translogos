A son of twelve years `is' Manasseh in his reigning
and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
and he turneth and buildeth the high places that Hezekiah his father destroyed
And he hath built altars in the house of Jehovah
And he buildeth altars to all the host of the heavens in the two courts of the house of Jehovah;"
and he hath caused his son to pass through fire
And he setteth the graven image of the shrine that he made in the house of which Jehovah said unto David and unto Solomon his son
and I do not add to cause the foot of Israel to move from the ground that I gave to their fathers
And they have not hearkened
And Jehovah speaketh by the hand of his servants the prophets
`Because that Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations -- he hath done evil above all that the Amorites have done who `are' before him
therefore thus said Jehovah
And I have stretched out over Jerusalem the line of Samaria
`And I have left the remnant of Mine inheritance
because that they have done the evil thing in Mine eyes
And also
And the rest of the matters of Manasseh
And Manasseh lieth with his fathers
A son of twenty and two years `is' Amon in his reigning
and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
and walketh in all the way that his father walked in
and forsaketh Jehovah
And the servants of Amon conspire against him
and the people of the land smite all those conspiring against king Amon
And the rest of the matters of Amon that he did
and `one' burieth him in his burying-place in the garden of Uzza
