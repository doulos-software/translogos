And sons of the prophet say unto Elisha
let us go
And the one saith
And he goeth with them
and it cometh to pass
And the man of God saith
and saith
And the king of Aram hath been fighting against Israel
And the man of God sendeth unto the king of Israel
and the king of Israel sendeth unto the place of which the man of God spake to him
And the heart of the king of Aram is tossed about concerning this thing
And one of his servants saith
And he saith
And he sendeth thither horses and chariot
And the servant of the man of God riseth early
And he saith
And Elisha prayeth
And they come down unto it
And Elisha saith unto them
And it cometh to pass
And the king of Israel saith unto Elisha
And he saith
And he prepareth for them great provision
And it cometh to pass afterwards
and there is a great famine in Samaria
And it cometh to pass
And he saith
And the king saith to her
and we boil my son and eat him
And it cometh to pass
And he saith
And Elisha is sitting in his house
He is yet speaking with them
