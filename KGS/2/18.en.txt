And it cometh to pass
a son of twenty and five years was he in his reigning
And he doth that which `is' right in the eyes of Jehovah
he hath turned aside the high places
In Jehovah
and he cleaveth to Jehovah
And Jehovah hath been with him
he hath smitten the Philistines unto Gaza
And it cometh to pass
and they capture it at the end of three years; in the sixth year of Hezekiah -- it `is' the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel -- hath Samaria been captureth
and the king of Asshur removeth Israel to Asshur
because that they have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God
And in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah hath Sennacherib king of Asshur come up against all the fenced cities of Judah
and Hezekiah king of Judah sendeth unto the king of Asshur to Lachish
and Hezekiah giveth all the silver that is found in the house of Jehovah
at that time hath Hezekiah cut off the doors of the temple of Jehovah
And the king of Asshur sendeth Tartan
And they call unto the king
And the chief of the butlers saith unto them
Thou hast said: Only a word of the lips! counsel and might `are' for battle; now
`Now
`And when ye say unto me
`And
And how dost thou turn back the face of one captain of the least of the servants of my lord
Now
And Eliakim son of Hilkiah saith -- and Shebna
And the chief of the butlers saith unto them
And the chief of the butlers standeth and calleth with a great voice `in' Jewish
thus said the king
and let not Hezekiah make you trust unto Jehovah
`Do not hearken unto Hezekiah
till my coming in
`Have the gods of the nations delivered at all each his land out of the hand of the king of Asshur?"
Where `are' the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where the gods of Sepharvaim
Who `are they' among all the gods of the lands that have delivered their land out of my hand
And the people have kept silent
And Eliakim son of Hilkiah
