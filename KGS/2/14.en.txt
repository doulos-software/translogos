In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned hath Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah;"
a son of twenty and five years was he in his reigning
and he doth that which `is' right in the eyes of Jehovah
only
And it cometh to pass
and the sons of those smiting `him' he hath not put to death
He hath smitten Edom
then hath Amaziah sent messengers unto Jehoash son of Jehoahaz
And Jehoash king of Israel sendeth unto Amaziah king of Judah
Thou hast certainly smitten Edom
And Amaziah hath not hearkened
and Judah is smitten before Israel
And Amaziah king of Judah
and hath taken all the gold and the silver
And the rest of the matters of Jehoash that he did
And Jehoash lieth with his fathers
And Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah liveth after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years
and the rest of the matters of Amaziah are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
And they make a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem
and lift him up on the horses
And all the people of Judah take Azariah
he hath built Elath
In the fifteenth year of Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah
and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
He hath brought back the border of Israel
for Jehovah hath seen the affliction of Israel -- very bitter
and Jehovah hath not spoken to blot out the name of Israel from under the heavens
And the rest of the matters of Jeroboam
And Jeroboam lieth with his fathers
