And Elisha saith
And the captain whom the king hath
And four men have been leprous
if we have said
And they rise in the twilight
seeing Jehovah hath caused the camp of Aram to hear a noise of chariot and a noise of horse -- a noise of great force
And they rise and flee in the twilight
And these lepers come in unto the extremity of the camp
And they say one unto another
And they come in
and he calleth the gatekeepers
And the king riseth by night
And one of his servants answereth and saith
And they take two chariot-horses
And they go after them unto the Jordan
And the people go out and spoil the camp of Aram
And the king hath appointed the captain
yea
and the captain answereth the man of God
and it cometh to him so
