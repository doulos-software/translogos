And Jehoram son of Ahab hath reigned over Israel
and doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
only to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat that he caused Israel to sin he hath cleaved
And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master
and it cometh to pass at the death of Ahab
And king Jehoram goeth out in that day from Samaria
and goeth and sendeth unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah
And he saith
And the king of Israel goeth
and the king of Israel saith
And Jehoshaphat saith
And Jehoshaphat saith
And Elisha saith unto the king of Israel
And Elisha saith
and now
and he saith
for thus said Jehovah
`And this hath been light in the eyes of Jehovah
and ye have smitten every fenced city
And it cometh to pass in the morning
and all Moab have heard that the kings have come up to fight against them
And they rise early in the morning
and say
And they come in unto the camp of Israel
and the cities they break down
And the king of Moab seeth that the battle has been too strong for him
and he taketh his son
