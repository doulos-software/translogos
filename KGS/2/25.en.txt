And it cometh to pass
And the city entereth into siege till the eleventh year of king Zedekiah
on the ninth of the month -- when the famine is severe in the city
then the city is broken up
And the force of the Chaldeans pursue after the king
and they seize the king
And the sons of Zedekiah they have slaughtered before his eyes
And in the fifth month
and he burneth the house of Jehovah
and the walls of Jerusalem round about have all the forces of the Chaldeans
And the rest of the people
and of the poor of the land hath the chief of the executioners left for vine-dressers and for husbandmen."
And the pillars of brass that `are' in the house of Jehovah
And the pots
and the fire-pans
The two pillars
eighteen cubits `is' the height of the one pillar
And the chief of the executioners taketh Seraiah the head priest
and out of the city he hath taken a certain eunuch who is appointed over the men of war
and Nebuzaradan chief of the executioners taketh them
and the king of Babylon smiteth them
And the people that is left in the land of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon hath left -- he appointeth over them Gedaliah son of Ahikam
And all the heads of the forces hear -- they and the men -- that the king of Babylon hath appointed Gedaliah
and Gedaliah sweareth to them
And it cometh to pass
And all the people rise
And it cometh to pass
and speaketh with him good things and putteth his throne above the throne of the kings who `are' with him in Babylon
and hath changed the garments of his restraint
and his allowance -- a continual allowance -- hath been given to him from the king
