And a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets hath cried unto Elisha
And Elisha saith unto her
And he saith
and thou hast entered
And she goeth from him
and it cometh to pass
And she cometh and declareth to the man of God
And the day cometh that Elisha passeth over unto Shunem
and she saith unto her husband
let us make
And the day cometh
and he saith unto Gehazi his young man
And he saith to him
And he saith
And he saith
and he saith
And the woman conceiveth and beareth a son
And the lad groweth
and he saith unto his father
and he beareth him
And she goeth up
and calleth unto her husband
And he saith
And she saddleth the ass
And she goeth
now
And she cometh in unto the man of God
And she saith
And he saith to Gehazi
And the mother of the youth saith
And Gehazi hath passed on before them
And Elisha cometh in to the house
and he goeth in and shutteth the door upon them both
And he goeth up
and he turneth back and walketh in the house
And he calleth unto Gehazi
And she goeth in
And Elisha hath turned back to Gilgal
And one goeth out unto the field to gather herbs
and they pour out for the men to eat
And he saith
And a man hath come from Baal-Shalishah
And his minister saith
and he giveth before them
