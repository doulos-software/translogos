And the men of Israel have sworn in Mizpeh
And the people come in to Beth-El
and say
And it cometh to pass on the morrow
And the sons of Israel say
And the sons of Israel repent concerning Benjamin their brother
what do we do for them -- for those who are left -- for wives
And they say
And the people numbered themselves
And the company send there twelve thousand men of the sons of valour
And this `is' the thing which ye do; every male
And they find out of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead four hundred young women
And all the company send
and Benjamin turneth back at that time
And the people repented concerning Benjamin
And the elders of the company say
And they say
and we -- we are not able to give to them wives out of our daughters
And they say
And they command the sons of Benjamin
and have seen
and it hath been
And the sons of Benjamin do so
And the sons of Israel go up and down thence at that time
In those days there is no king in Israel; each doth that which is right in his own eyes."
