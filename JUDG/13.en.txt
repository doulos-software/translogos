And the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
And there is a certain man of Zorah
and a messenger of Jehovah appeareth unto the woman
And
for
And the woman cometh and speaketh to her husband
and he saith to me
And Manoah maketh entreaty unto Jehovah
And God hearkeneth to the voice of Manoah
and the woman hasteth
And Manoah riseth
And Manoah saith
And the messenger of Jehovah saith unto Manoah
of anything which cometh out from the wine-vine she doth not eat
And Manoah saith unto the messenger of Jehovah
And the messenger of Jehovah saith unto Manoah
And Manoah saith unto the messenger of Jehovah
And the messenger of Jehovah saith to him
And Manoah taketh the kid of the goats
and it cometh to pass
and the messenger of Jehovah hath not added again to appear unto Manoah
And Manoah saith unto his wife
And his wife saith to him
And the woman beareth a son
and the Spirit of Jehovah beginneth to move him in the camp of Dan
