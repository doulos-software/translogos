and Abimelech son of Jerubbaal goeth to Shechem
`Speak
And his mother's brethren speak concerning him
and they give to him seventy silverings out of the house of Baal-Berith
and he goeth into the house of his father at Ophrah
And all the masters of Shechem are gathered together
and they declare `it' to Jotham
`The trees have diligently gone to anoint over them a king
And the olive saith to them
And the trees say to the fig
And the fig saith to them
`And the trees say to the vine
And the vine saith to them
And all the trees say unto the bramble
And the bramble saith unto the trees
`And
because my father hath fought for you
and ye have risen against the house of my father to-day
yea
and if not -- fire cometh out from Abimelech and devoureth the masters of Shechem and the house of Millo
And Jotham hasteth
And Abimelech is prince over Israel three years
and God sendeth an evil spirit between Abimelech and the masters of Shechem
for the coming in of the violence `to' the seventy sons of Jerubbaal
And the masters of Shechem set for him ambushes on the top of the hills
And Gaal son of Ebed cometh -- also his brethren -- and they pass over into Shechem
and go out into the field
And Gaal son of Ebed saith
and oh that this people were in my hand -- then I turn Abimelech aside;' and he saith to Abimelech
And Zebul
and he sendeth messengers unto Abimelech deceitfully
and
and it hath been
And Abimelech riseth
and Gaal son of Ebed goeth out
and Gaal seeth the people
And Gaal addeth yet to speak
And Zebul saith unto him
And Gaal goeth out before the masters of Shechem
and Abimelech pursueth him
And Abimelech abideth in Arumah
And it cometh to pass
and he taketh the people
And Abimelech and the detachments who `are' with him have pushed on
and Abimelech hath fought against the city all that day
And all the masters of the tower of Shechem hear
and it is declared to Abimelech that all the masters of the tower of Shechem have gathered themselves together
and Abimelech goeth up to mount Zalmon
And all the people also cut down each one his bough
And Abimelech goeth unto Thebez
and a strong tower hath been in the midst of the city
And Abimelech cometh unto the tower
and a certain woman doth cast a piece of a rider on the head of Abimelech
and he calleth hastily unto the young man bearing his weapons
And the men of Israel see that Abimelech `is' dead
and God turneth back the evil of Abimelech which he did to his father to slay his seventy brethren;"
and all the evil of the men of Shechem hath God turned back on their head
