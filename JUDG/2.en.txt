And a messenger of Jehovah goeth up from Gilgal unto Bochim
and saith
And I also have said
And it cometh to pass
and they call the name of that place Bochim
And Joshua sendeth the people away
and the people serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua
And Joshua son of Nun
and they bury him in the border of his inheritance
and also all that generation have been gathered unto their fathers
And the sons of Israel do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
and forsake Jehovah
yea
And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel
in every `place' where they have gone out
And Jehovah raiseth up judges
and also unto their judges they have not hearkened
And when Jehovah raised up to them judges -- then was Jehovah with the judge
And it hath come to pass
And the anger of Jehovah doth burn against Israel
I also continue not to dispossess any from before them of the nations which Joshua hath left when he dieth
in order to try Israel by them
And Jehovah leaveth these nations
