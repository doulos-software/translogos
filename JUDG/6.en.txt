And the sons of Israel do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
and the hand of Midian is strong against Israel
And it hath been
and encamp against them
for they and their cattle come up
And Israel is very weak from the presence of Midian
And it cometh to pass when the sons of Israel have cried unto Jehovah
that Jehovah sendeth a man
and I deliver you out of the hand of the Egyptians
and I say to you
And the messenger of Jehovah cometh and sitteth under the oak which `is' in Ophrah
and the messenger of Jehovah appeareth unto him
And Gideon saith unto him
And Jehovah turneth unto him and saith
And he saith unto him
And Jehovah saith unto him
And he saith unto Him
Move not
And Gideon hath gone in
And the messenger of God saith unto him
And the messenger of Jehovah putteth forth the end of the staff which `is' in His hand
And Gideon seeth that He `is' a messenger of Jehovah
And Jehovah saith to him
And Gideon buildeth there an altar to Jehovah
And it cometh to pass
and thou hast built an altar to Jehovah thy God on the top of this stronghold
And Gideon taketh ten men of his servants
And the men of the city rise early in the morning
And they say one to another
And the men of the city say unto Joash
And Joash saith to all who have stood against him
And he calleth him
And all Midian and Amalek and the sons of the east have been gathered together
and the Spirit of Jehovah hath clothed Gideon
and messengers he hath sent into all Manasseh
And Gideon saith unto God
lo
and it is so
And Gideon saith unto God
And God doth so on that night
