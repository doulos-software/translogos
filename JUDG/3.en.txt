And these `are' the nations which Jehovah left
(only for the sake of the generations of the sons of Israel's knowing
five princes of the Philistines
and they are to prove Israel by them
And the sons of Israel have dwelt in the midst of the Canaanite
and take their daughters to them for wives
and the sons of Israel do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel
and the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah
and the Spirit of Jehovah is upon him
and the land resteth forty years. And Othniel son of Kenaz dieth
and the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah; and Jehovah strengtheneth Eglon king of Moab against Israel
and he gathereth unto him the Bene-Ammon and Amalek
and the sons of Israel serve Eglon king of Moab eighteen years."
And the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah
and Ehud maketh for himself a sword
and he bringeth near the present to Eglon king of Moab
And it cometh to pass
and he himself hath turned back from the graven images which `are' at Gilgal
And Ehud hath come unto him
and Ehud putteth forth his left hand
and the haft also goeth in after the blade
And Ehud goeth out at the porch
and he hath gone out
And they stay till confounded
And Ehud escaped during their tarrying
And it cometh to pass
and he saith unto them
And they smite Moab at that time
and Moab is humbled in that day under the hand of Israel; and the land resteth eighty years."
And after him hath been Shamgar son of Anath
