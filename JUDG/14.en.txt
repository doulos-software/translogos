And Samson goeth down to Timnath
and cometh up and declareth to his father
And his father saith to him -- also his mother
And his father and his mother have not known that from Jehovah it `is'
And Samson goeth down -- also his father and his mother
and the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him
And he goeth down and speaketh to the woman
and he turneth back after `some' days to take her
And he taketh it down on to his hands
And his father goeth down unto the woman
and it cometh to pass when they see him
And Samson saith to them
and if ye are not able to declare `it' to me
And he saith to them: `Out of the eater came forth meat
And it cometh to pass
And Samson's wife weepeth for it
And she weepeth for it the seven days `in' which their banquet hath been
And the men of the city say to him on the seventh day
And the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him
and Samson's wife becometh his companion's
