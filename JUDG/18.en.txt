In those days there is no king in Israel
And the sons of Dan send
They `are' with the household of Micah
And he saith unto them
And they say to him
And the priest saith to them
And the five men go
And they come in unto their brethren
And they say
When ye go
And there journey thence
And they go up and encamp in Kirjath-Jearim
And they pass over thence `to' the hill-country of Ephraim
And the five men
And they turn aside thither
(and the six hundred men girded with their weapons of war
yea
yea
and they say to him
And the heart of the priest is glad
and they turn and go
They have been far off from the house of Micah -- and the men who `are' in the houses which `are' near the house of Micah have been called together
and call unto the sons of Dan
And he saith
And the sons of Dan say unto him
and the sons of Dan go on their way
And they have taken that which Micah had made
and there is no deliverer
and call the name of the city Dan
And the sons of Dan raise up for themselves the graven image
And they appoint for them the graven image of Micah
