And the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah when Ehud is dead
and Jehovah selleth them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan
and the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah
And Deborah
and she is dwelling under the palm-tree of Deborah
And she sendeth and calleth for Barak son of Abinoam
and I have drawn unto thee
And Barak saith unto her
and she saith
And Barak calleth Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh
And Heber the Kenite hath been separated from the Kenite
And they declare to Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam hath gone up to mount Tabor
and Sisera calleth all his chariots
And Deborah saith unto Barak
And Jehovah destroyeth Sisera
And Barak hath pursued after the chariots and after the camp
And Sisera hath fled on his feet unto the tent of Jael wife of Heber the Kenite
and Jael goeth out to meet Sisera
And he saith unto her
And he saith unto her
And Jael wife of Heber taketh the pin of the tent
And lo
And God humbleth on that day Jabin king of Canaan before the sons of Israel
and the hand of the sons of Israel goeth
