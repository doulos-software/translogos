And there is a man of the hill-country of Ephraim
and he saith to his mother
And he giveth back the eleven hundred silverlings to his mother
And he giveth back the money to his mother
As to the man Micah
in those days there is no king in Israel
And there is a young man of Beth-Lehem-Judah
And the man goeth out of the city
And Micah saith to him
And Micah saith to him
And the Levite is willing to dwell with the man
And Micah consecrateth the hand of the Levite
and Micah saith
