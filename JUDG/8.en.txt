And the men of Ephraim say unto him
and he saith unto them
Into your hand hath God given the heads of Midian
And Gideon cometh in unto the Jordan
and he saith to the men of Succoth
And the heads of Succoth say
And Gideon saith
And he goeth up thence `to' Penuel
And he speaketh also to the men of Penuel
And Zebah and Zalmunna `are' in Karkor
And Gideon goeth up the way of those who tabernacle in tents
and Zebab and Zalmunna flee
And Gideon son of Joash turneth back from the battle
and captureth a young man of the men of Succoth
And he cometh in unto the men of Succoth
And he taketh the elders of the city
and the tower of Penuel he hath broken down
And he saith unto Zebah and unto Zalmunna
And he saith
And he saith to Jether his first-born
And Zebah saith -- also Zalmunna -- `Rise thou
And the men of Israel say unto Gideon
And Gideon saith unto them
And Gideon saith unto them
And they say
and the weight of the rings of gold which he asked is a thousand and seven hundred `shekels' of gold
and Gideon maketh it into an ephod
And Midian is humbled before the sons of Israel
And Jerubbaal son of Joash goeth and dwelleth in his own house
and to Gideon there have been seventy sons
and his concubine
And Gideon son of Joash dieth
And it cometh to pass
and the sons of Israel have not remembered Jehovah their God
neither have they done kindness with the house of Jerubbaal -- Gideon -- according to all the good which he did with Israel."
