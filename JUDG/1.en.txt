And it cometh to pass
And Jehovah saith
And Judah saith to Simeon his brother
And Judah goeth up
and they find Adoni-Bezek in Bezek
And Adoni-Bezek fleeth
and Adoni-Bezek saith
And the sons of Judah fight against Jerusalem
and afterwards have the sons of Judah gone down to fight against the Canaanite
and Judah goeth unto the Canaanite who is dwelling in Hebron (and the name of Hebron formerly `is' Kirjath-Arba)
And he goeth thence unto the inhabitants of Debir (and the name of Debir formerly `is' Kirjath-Sepher)
and Caleb saith
And Othniel son of Kenaz
And it cometh to pass in her coming in
And she saith to him
And the sons of the Kenite
And Judah goeth with Simeon his brother
And Judah captureth Gaza and its border
and Jehovah is with Judah
And they give to Caleb Hebron
And the Jebusite
And the house of Joseph go up -- even they -- to Beth-El
and the house of Joseph cause `men' to spy about Beth-El (and the name of the city formerly is Luz)
and the watchers see a man coming out from the city
And he sheweth them the entrance of the city
and the man goeth to the land of the Hittites
And Manasseh hath not occupied Beth-Shean and its towns
and it cometh to pass
And Ephraim hath not dispossessed the Canaanite who is dwelling in Gezer
Zebulun hath not dispossessed the inhabitants of Kitron
Asher hath not dispossessed the inhabitants of Accho
and the Asherite dwelleth in the midst of the Canaanite
Naphtali hath not dispossessed the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh
And the Amorites press the sons of Dan to the mountain
and the Amorite is desirous to dwell in mount Heres
and the border of the Amorite `is' from the ascent of Akrabbim
