And the men of Ephraim are called together
And Jephthah saith unto them
and I see that thou art not a saviour
And Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead
And Gilead captureth the passages of the Jordan to Ephraim
that they say to him
And Jephthah judged Israel six years
And after him Ibzan of Beth-Lehem judgeth Israel
and he hath thirty sons and thirty daughters
And Ibzan dieth
And after him Elon the Zebulunite judgeth Israel
and Elon the Zebulunite dieth
And after him
and he hath forty sons
And Abdon son of Hillel
