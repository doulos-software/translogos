And Jephthah the Gileadite hath been a mighty man of valour
and the wife of Gilead beareth to him sons
And Jephthah fleeth from the face of his brethren
And it cometh to pass
and it cometh to pass
and they say unto Jephthah
And Jephthah saith to the elders of Gilead
and the elders of Gilead say unto Jephthah
And Jephthah saith unto the elders of Gilead
And the elders of Gilead say unto Jephthah
And Jephthah goeth with the elders of Gilead
And Jephthah sendeth messengers unto the king of the Bene-Ammon
And the king of the Bene-Ammon saith unto the messengers of Jephthah
And Jephthah addeth yet and sendeth messengers unto the king of the Bene-Ammon
and saith to him
for in their coming up out of Egypt
and Israel sendeth messengers unto the king of Edom
and he goeth through the wilderness
`And Israel sendeth messengers unto Sihon
and Sihon hath not trusted Israel to pass over through his border
and Jehovah
and they possess all the border of the Amorite from Arnon
`And now
That which Chemosh thy god causeth thee to possess -- dost thou not possess it? and all that which Jehovah our God hath dispossessed from our presence
`And now
In Israel's dwelling in Heshbon and in its towns
And I -- I have not sinned against thee
And the king of the Bene-Ammon hath not hearkened unto the words of Jephthah which he sent unto him
and the Spirit of Jehovah is on Jephthah
And Jephthah voweth a vow to Jehovah
then it hath been
And Jephthah passeth over unto the Bene-Ammon to fight against them
and he smiteth them from Aroer
And Jephthah cometh into Mizpeh
And it cometh to pass
And she saith unto him
And she saith unto her father
And he saith
and it cometh to pass at the end of two months that she turneth back unto her father
from time to time the daughters of Israel go to talk to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite
