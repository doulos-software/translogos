And it cometh to pass
and her father saith
And Samson saith of them
And Samson goeth and catcheth three hundred foxes
and kindleth fire in the torches
And the Philistines say
And Samson saith to them
And he smiteth them hip and thigh -- a great smiting
And the Philistines go up
and the men of Judah say
And three thousand men of Judah go down unto the cleft of the rock Etam
And they say to him
And they speak to him
He hath come unto Lehi -- and the Philistines have shouted at meeting him -- and the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him
and he findeth a fresh jaw-bone of an ass
And Samson saith
And it cometh to pass when he finisheth speaking
and he thirsteth exceedingly
And God cleaveth the hollow place which `is' in Lehi
And he judgeth Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years."
