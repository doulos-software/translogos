And all the sons of Israel go out
And the chiefs of all the people
And the sons of Benjamin hear that the sons of Israel have gone up to Mizpeh. And the sons of Israel say
And the man
and rise against me do the masters of Gibeah -- and they go round the house against me by night -- me they thought to slay
and I lay hold on my concubine
lo
And all the people rise as one man
and now
and we have taken ten men of a hundred
And every man of Israel is gathered unto the city
And the tribes of Israel send men among all the tribes of Benjamin
And now
and the sons of Benjamin are gathered out of the cities to Gibeah
And the sons of Benjamin number themselves on that day; out of the cities `are' twenty and six thousand men drawing sword
among all this people `are' seven hundred chosen men
And the men of Israel numbered themselves
And they rise and go up to Beth-El
And the sons of Israel rise in the morning
and the men of Israel go out to battle with Benjamin
and the sons of Benjamin come out from Gibeah
And the people
And the sons of Israel go up and weep before Jehovah till the evening
And the sons of Israel draw near unto the sons of Benjamin on the second day
and Benjamin cometh out to meet them from Gibeah on the second day
And all the sons of Israel go up
And the sons of Israel ask of Jehovah
and Phinehas son of Eleazar
And Israel setteth liers in wait against Gibeah
and the sons of Israel go up against the sons of Benjamin
And the sons of Benjamin come out to meet the people; they have been drawn away out of the city
And the sons of Benjamin say
And all the men of Israel have risen from their place
And they come in over against Gibeah -- ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel -- and the battle `is' grievous
And Jehovah smiteth Benjamin before Israel
And the sons of Benjamin see that they have been smitten -- and the men of Israel give place to Benjamin
and the ambush have hasted
And there was the appointed sign to the men of Israel with the ambush -- their causing to go up a great volume of smoke from the city."
And the men of Israel turn in battle
and the volume hath begun to go up from the city -- a pillar of smoke -- and Benjamin turneth behind
And the men of Israel have turned
and they turn before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness
they have compassed the Benjamites -- they have pursued them -- with ease they have trodden them down till over-against Gibeah
And there fall of Benjamin eighteen thousand men -- the whole of these `are' men of valour;"
and they turn and flee toward the wilderness
And all those falling of Benjamin are twenty and five thousand men drawing sword
and there turn and flee into the wilderness
And the men of Israel have turned back unto the sons of Benjamin
