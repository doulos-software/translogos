And Samson goeth to Gaza
`it is told' to the Gazathites
And Samson lieth down till the middle of the night
And it cometh to pass afterwards that he loveth a woman in the valley of Sorek
and the princes of the Philistines come up unto her
And Delilah saith unto Samson
And Samson saith unto her
And the princes of the Philistines bring up to her seven green withs which have not been dried
And the ambush is abiding with her in an inner chamber
And Delilah saith unto Samson
And he saith unto her
And Delilah taketh thick bands
And Delilah saith unto Samson
And she fixeth `it' with the pin
And she saith unto him
And it cometh to pass
that he declareth to her all his heart
And Delilah seeth that he hath declared to her all his heart
and she maketh him sleep on her knees
and she saith
And the Philistines seize him
And the hair of his head beginneth to shoot up
and the princes of the Philistines have been gathered together to sacrifice a great sacrifice to Dagon their god
And the people see him
And it cometh to pass
And Samson saith unto the young man who is keeping hold on his hand
And the house hath been full of men and of women
And Samson calleth unto Jehovah
And Samson turneth aside `to' the two middle pillars
and Samson saith
And his brethren come down
