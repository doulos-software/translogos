And there riseth after Abimelech
and he judgeth Israel twenty and three years
And there riseth after him Jair the Gileadite
and he hath thirty sons riding on thirty ass-colts
and Jair dieth
And the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
and the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel
and they crush and oppress the sons of Israel in that year -- eighteen years all the sons of Israel `who' are beyond the Jordan
And the Bene-Ammon pass over the Jordan to fight also against Judah
And the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah
And Jehovah saith unto the sons of Israel
And the Zidonians
and ye -- ye have forsaken Me
Go and cry unto the gods on which ye have fixed; they -- they save you in the time of your adversity.'"
And the sons of Israel say unto Jehovah
And they turn aside the gods of the stranger out of their midst
And the Bene-Ammon are called together
And the people -- heads of Gilead -- say one unto another
