And Deborah singeth -- also Barak son of Abinoam -- on that day
`For freeing freemen in Israel
Hear
Jehovah
Hills flowed from the face of Jehovah
In the days of Shamgar son of Anath -- In the days of Jael -- The ways have ceased
Villages ceased in Israel -- they ceased
He chooseth new gods
My heart `is' to the lawgivers of Israel
Riders on white asses -- Sitters on a long robe -- And walkers by the way -- meditate!"
By the voice of shouters Between the places of drawing water
Awake
Then him who is left of the honourable ones He caused to rule the people of Jehovah
Out of Ephraim their root `is' against Amalek. After thee
And princes in Issachar `are' with Deborah
Why hast thou abode between the boundaries
Gilead beyond the Jordan did tabernacle
Zebulun `is' a people who exposed its soul to death
Kings came -- they fought; Then fought kings of Canaan
From the heavens they fought: The stars from their highways fought with Sisera."
The brook Kishon swept them away
Then broken were the horse-heels
Curse Meroz -- said a messenger of Jehovah
Blessed above women is Jael
Water he asked -- milk she gave; In a lordly dish she brought near butter."
Her hand to the pin she sendeth forth
Between her feet he bowed -- He fell
Through the window she hath looked out -- Yea
The wise ones
Do they not find? -- they apportion spoil
So do all Thine enemies perish
