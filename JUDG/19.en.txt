And it cometh to pass
and commit whoredom against him doth his concubine
And her husband riseth and goeth after her
And keep hold on him doth his father-in-law
And it cometh to pass
And they sit and eat both of them together
And the man riseth to go
And he riseth early in the morning
And the man riseth to go
And the man hath not been willing to lodge all night
They `are' near Jebus
And his lord saith unto him
And he saith to his young man
And they pass over
and they turn aside there to go in to lodge in Gibeah
And lo
And he lifteth up his eyes
And he saith unto him
and both straw and provender are for our asses
And the old man saith
And he bringeth him in to his house
They are making their heart glad
And the man
lo
And the men have not been willing to hearken to him
and the woman cometh in at the turning of the morning
And her lord riseth in the morning
and he saith unto her
and cometh in unto his house
And it hath come to pass
