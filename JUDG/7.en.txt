And Jerubbaal (he `is' Gideon) riseth early
And Jehovah saith unto Gideon
and now
And Jehovah saith unto Gideon
And he bringeth down the people unto the water
And the number of those lapping with their hand unto their mouth is three hundred men
And Jehovah saith unto Gideon
And the people take the provision in their hand
And it cometh to pass
and if thou art afraid to go down -- go down
and thou hast heard what they speak
and Midian and Amalek
And Gideon cometh in
And his companion answereth and saith
And it cometh to pass
And he divideth the three hundred men `into' three detachments
And he saith unto them
and I have blown with a trumpet -- I and all who `are' with me
And Gideon cometh -- and the hundred men who `are' with him -- into the extremity of the camp
and the three detachments blow with trumpets
And they stand each in his place
and the three hundred blow the trumpets
And the men of Israel are called from Naphtali
And messengers hath sent Gideon into all the hill-country of Ephraim
and they capture two of the heads of Midian
