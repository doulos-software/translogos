And Jehovah saith unto Moses
except for his relation who `is' near unto him -- for his mother
and for his sister
`A master `priest' doth not defile himself among his people -- to pollute himself;"
they do not make baldness on their head
they are holy to their God
`A woman
and thou hast sanctified him
`And a daughter of any priest when she polluteth herself by going a-whoring -- her father she is polluting; with fire she is burnt."
`And the high priest of his brethren
nor beside any dead person doth he come; for his father and for his mother he doth not defile himself;"
nor from the sanctuary doth he go out
`And he taketh a wife in her virginity;"
widow
and he doth not pollute his seed among his people; for I `am' Jehovah
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto Aaron
for no man in whom `is' blemish doth draw near -- a man blind
or a man in whom there is a breach in the foot
or hump-backed
`No man in whom is blemish (of the seed of Aaron the priest) doth come nigh to bring near the fire-offerings of Jehovah; blemish `is' in him; the bread of his God he doth not come nigh to bring near."
`Bread of his God -- of the most holy things
only
And Moses speaketh unto Aaron
