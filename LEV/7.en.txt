`And this `is' a law of the guilt-offering: it `is' most holy;"
in the place where they slaughter the burnt-offering they do slaughter the guilt-offering
and all its fat he bringeth near out of it
and the two kidneys
and the priest hath made them a perfume on the altar
`Every male among the priests doth eat it; in the holy place it is eaten -- it `is' most holy;"
as `is' a sin-offering
`And the priest who is bringing near any man's burnt-offering
and every present which is baked in an oven
and every present
`And this `is' a law of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings which `one' bringeth near to Jehovah:"
if for a thank-offering he bring it near
besides the cakes
and he hath brought near out of it one of the whole offering -- a heave-offering to Jehovah; to the priest who is sprinkling the blood of the peace-offerings -- it is his;"
as to the flesh of the sacrifice of the thank-offering of his peace-offerings
`And if the sacrifice of his offering `is' a vow or free-will offering
and the remnant of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day with fire is burnt;"
and if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be really eaten on the third day
`And the flesh which cometh against any unclean thing is not eaten; with fire it is burnt; as to the flesh
and the person who eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings which `are' Jehovah's
`And when a person cometh against any thing unclean
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
and the fat of a carcase
for whoever eateth the fat of the beast
`And any blood ye do not eat in all your dwellings
any person who eateth any blood
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
his own hands do bring in the fire-offerings of Jehovah
`And the priest hath made perfume with the fat on the altar
and the right leg ye do make a heave-offering to the priest of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings;"
he of the sons of Aaron who is bringing near the blood of the peace-offerings
`For the breast of the wave-offering
This `is' the anointing of Aaron
which Jehovah hath commanded to give to them in the day of His anointing them
This `is' the law for burnt-offering
which Jehovah hath commanded Moses in Mount Sinai
