And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto Aaron
`Say unto them
`Any man of the seed of Aaron
or a man who cometh against any teeming thing which is unclean to him
the person who cometh against it -- hath even been unclean till the evening
and the sun hath gone in
a carcase or torn thing he doth not eat
`And they have kept My charge
`And no stranger doth eat of the holy thing; a settler of a priest and an hireling doth not eat of the holy thing;"
and when a priest buyeth a person
`And a priest's daughter
and a priest's daughter
`And when a man doth eat of a holy thing through ignorance
and they do not pollute the holy things of the sons of Israel -- that which they lift up to Jehovah
nor have caused them to bear the iniquity of the guilt-offering in their eating their holy things; for I `am' Jehovah
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto Aaron
at your pleasure a perfect one
nothing in which `is' blemish do ye bring near
`And when a man bringeth near a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Jehovah
blind
`As to an ox or a sheep enlarged or dwarfed -- a willing-offering ye do make it
As to a bruised
And from the hand of a son of a stranger ye do not bring near the bread of your God
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`When ox or lamb or goat is born
but an ox or sheep -- it and its young one
`And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Jehovah
on that day it is eaten
and ye have kept my commands
and ye do not pollute My holy name
who am bringing you up out of the land of Egypt
