And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto all the company of the sons of Israel
`Each his mother and his father ye do fear
`Ye do not turn unto the idols
`And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Jehovah
in the day of your sacrificing it is eaten
and if it be really eaten on the third day
and he who is eating it his iniquity doth bear
`And in your reaping the harvest of your land ye do not completely reap the corner of thy field
and thy vineyard thou dost not glean
`Ye do not steal
`And ye do not swear by My name to falsehood
`Thou dost not oppress thy neighbour
`Thou dost not revile the deaf; and before the blind thou dost not put a stumbling block; and thou hast been afraid of thy God; I `am' Jehovah."
`Ye do not do perversity in judgment; thou dost not lift up the face of the poor
`Thou dost not go slandering among thy people; thou dost not stand against the blood of thy neighbour; I `am' Jehovah."
`Thou dost not hate thy brother in thy heart; thou dost certainly reprove thy fellow
`Thou dost not take vengeance
`My statutes ye do keep: thy cattle thou dost not cause to gender `with' diverse kinds; thy field thou dost not sow with diverse kinds
`And when a man lieth with a woman with seed of copulation
`And he hath brought in his guilt-offering to Jehovah
and the priest hath made atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering before Jehovah
`And when ye come in unto the land
and in the fourth year all its fruit is holy -- praises for Jehovah."
And in the fifth year ye do eat its fruit -- to add to you its increase; I `am' Jehovah your God."
`Ye do not eat with the blood; ye do not enchant
`Ye do not round the corner of your head
`And a cutting for the soul ye do not put in your flesh; and a writing
`Thou dost not pollute thy daughter to cause her to go a-whoring
`My sabbaths ye do keep
`Ye do not turn unto those having familiar spirits; and unto wizards ye do not seek
`At the presence of grey hairs thou dost rise up
`And when a sojourner sojourneth with thee in your land
as a native among you is the sojourner to you who is sojourning with you
`Ye do not do perversity in judgment
righteous balances
and ye have observed all my statutes
