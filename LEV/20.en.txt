And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`And unto the sons of Israel thou dost say
and I -- I set My face against that man
`And if the people of the land really hide their eyes from that man
then I have set My face against that man
`And the person who turneth unto those having familiar spirits
`And ye have sanctified yourselves
and ye have kept My statutes and have done them; I `am' Jehovah
`For any man who revileth his father and his mother is certainly put to death; his father and his mother he hath reviled: his blood `is' on him."
`And a man who committeth adultery with a man's wife -- who committeth adultery with the wife of his neighbour -- the adulterer and the adulteress are surely put to death."
`And a man who lieth with his father's wife -- the nakedness of his father he hath uncovered -- both of them are certainly put to death; their blood `is' on them."
`And a man who lieth with his daughter-in-law -- both of them are certainly put to death; confusion they have made; their blood `is' on them."
`And a man who lieth with a male as one lieth with a woman; abomination both of them have done; they are certainly put to death; their blood `is' on them."
`And a man who taketh the woman and her mother -- it `is' wickedness; with fire they burn him and them
`And a man who giveth his lying with a beast is certainly put to death
`And a woman who draweth near unto any beast to lie with it -- thou hast even slain the woman and the beast; they are certainly put to death; their blood `is' on them."
`And a man who taketh his sister
`And a man who lieth with a sick woman
`And the nakedness of thy mother's sister
`And a man who lieth with his aunt
`And a man who taketh his brother's wife -- it `is' impurity; the nakedness of his brother he hath uncovered; childless they are."
`And ye have kept all My statutes
and ye walk not in the statutes of the nation which I am sending away from before you
and I say to you
`And ye have made separation between the pure beasts and the unclean
and ye have been holy to Me; for holy `am' I
`And a man or woman -- when there is in them a familiar spirit
