`And when a person bringeth near an offering
and he hath brought it in unto the sons of Aaron
and the remnant of the present `is' for Aaron and for his sons
`And when thou bringest near an offering
`And if thine offering `is' a present `made' on the girdel
divide thou it into parts
`And if thine offering `is' a present `made' on the frying-pan
and thou hast brought in the present which is made of these to Jehovah
and the priest hath lifted up from the present its memorial
and the remnant of the present `is' for Aaron and for his sons
No present which ye bring near to Jehovah is made fermented
`An offering of first-`fruits' -- ye bring them near to Jehovah
And every offering -- thy present -- with salt thou dost season
`And if thou bring near a present of first-ripe `fruits' to Jehovah
and thou hast put on it oil
and the priest hath made perfume with its memorial from its beaten out `corn'
