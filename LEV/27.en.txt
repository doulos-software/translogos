And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
When thy valuation hath been of the male from a son of twenty years even unto a son of sixty years
And if it `is' a female -- then hath thy valuation been thirty shekels;"
and if from a son of five years even unto a son of twenty years -- then hath thy valuation been of the male twenty shekels
and if from a son of a month even unto a son of five years -- then hath thy valuation been of the male five shekels of silver
and if from a son of sixty years and above -- if a male
`And if he is poorer than thy valuation
`And if `it is' a beast of which they bring near an offering to Jehovah
he doth not change it nor exchange it
`And if `it is' any unclean beast of which they do not bring near an offering to Jehovah
and the priest hath valued it; whether good or bad
and if he really redeem it
`And when a man sanctifieth his house
and if he who is sanctifying doth redeem his house
`And if of the field of his possession a man sanctify to Jehovah
if from the year of the jubilee he sanctify his field
and if after the jubilee he sanctify his field
`And if he really redeem the field -- he who is sanctifying it -- then he hath added a fifth of the money of thy valuation to it
and if he do not redeem the field
and the field hath been
`And if the field of his purchase (which `is' not of the fields of his possession) `one' sanctify to Jehovah --"
then hath the priest reckoned to him the amount of thy valuation unto the year of jubilee
in the year of the jubilee the field returneth to him from whom he bought it
And all thy valuation is by the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs is the shekel."
`Only
And if among the unclean beasts
`Only
`No devoted thing
And all tithe of the land
`And if a man really redeem `any' of his tithe
`And all the tithe of the herd and of the flock -- all that passeth by under the rod -- the tenth is holy to Jehovah;"
he enquireth not between good and bad
These `are' the commands which Jehovah hath commanded Moses for the sons of Israel
