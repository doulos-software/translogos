And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
according to the work of the land of Egypt in which ye have dwelt ye do not
`My judgments ye do
and ye have kept My statutes and My judgments which man doth and liveth in them; I `am' Jehovah."
`None of you unto any relation of his flesh doth draw near to uncover nakedness; I `am' Jehovah."
`The nakedness of thy father and the nakedness of thy mother thou dost not uncover
`The nakedness of the wife of thy father thou dost not uncover; it `is' the nakedness of thy father."
`The nakedness of thy sister
`The nakedness of thy son's daughter
`The nakedness of a daughter of thy father's wife
`The nakedness of a sister of thy father thou dost not uncover; she `is' a relation of thy father."
`The nakedness of thy mother's sister thou dost not uncover; for she `is' thy mother's relation."
`The nakedness of thy father's brother thou dost not uncover; unto his wife thou dost not draw near; she `is' thine aunt."
`The nakedness of thy daughter-in-law thou dost not uncover; she `is' thy son's wife; thou dost not uncover her nakedness."
`The nakedness of thy brother's wife thou dost not uncover; it `is' thy brother's nakedness."
`The nakedness of a woman and her daughter thou dost not uncover; her son's daughter
`And a woman unto another thou dost not take
`And unto a woman in the separation of her uncleanness thou dost not draw near to uncover her nakedness."
`And unto the wife of thy fellow thou dost not give thy seed of copulation
`And of thy seed thou dost not give to pass over to the Molech; nor dost thou pollute the name of thy God; I `am' Jehovah."
`And with a male thou dost not lie as one lieth with a woman; abomination it `is'."
`And with any beast thou dost not give thy copulation
`Ye are not defiled with all these
and the land is defiled
and ye -- ye have kept My statutes and My judgments
(for all these abominations have the men of the land done who `are' before you
and the land doth not vomit you out in your defiling it
for any one who doth `any' of all these abominations -- even the persons who are doing `so'
and ye have kept My charge
