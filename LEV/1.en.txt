And Jehovah calleth unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
`If his offering `is' a burnt-offering out of the herd -- a male
and he hath laid his hand on the head of the burnt-offering
and he hath slaughtered the son of the herd before Jehovah; and sons of Aaron
`And he hath stripped the burnt-offering
and the sons of Aaron the priest have put fire on the altar
and sons of Aaron
and its inwards and its legs he doth wash with water; and the priest hath made perfume with the whole on the altar
`And if his offering `is' out of the flock -- out of the sheep or out of the goats -- for a burnt-offering
and he hath slaughtered it by the side of the altar northward
and he hath cut it into its pieces
and the inwards and the legs he doth wash with water
`And if his offering `is' a burnt-offering out of the fowl to Jehovah
and the priest hath brought it near unto the altar
and he hath turned aside its crop with its feathers
and he hath cleaved it with its wings (he doth not separate `it')
