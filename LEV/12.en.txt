And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
and in the eighth day is the flesh of his foreskin circumcised;"
and thirty and three days she doth abide in the blood of her cleansing; against any holy thing she doth not come
`And if a female she bear
`And in the fulness of the days of her cleansing for son or for daughter she doth bring in a lamb
and he hath brought it near before Jehovah
`And if her hand find not the sufficiency of a sheep
