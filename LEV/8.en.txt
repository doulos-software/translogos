And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Take Aaron and his sons with him
and all the company assemble thou unto the opening of the tent of meeting.'"
And Moses doth as Jehovah hath commanded him
and Moses saith unto the company
And Moses bringeth near Aaron and his sons
and doth put on him the coat
and doth put on him the breastplate
and doth put the mitre on his head
And Moses taketh the anointing oil
and he sprinkleth of it on the altar seven times
and he poureth of the anointing oil on the head of Aaron
And Moses bringeth near the sons of Aaron
And he bringeth nigh the bullock of the sin-offering
and `one' slaughtereth
And he taketh all the fat that `is' on the inwards
and the bullock
And he bringeth near the ram of the burnt-offering
and `one' slaughtereth
and the ram he hath cut into its pieces
and the inwards and the legs he hath washed with water
And he bringeth near the second ram
and `one' slaughtereth
and he bringeth near the sons of Aaron
and taketh the fat
and out of the basket of unleavened things
and putteth the whole on the hands of Aaron
And Moses taketh them from off their hands
and Moses taketh the breast
And Moses taketh of the anointing oil
And Moses saith unto Aaron
`And the remnant of the flesh and of the bread with fire ye burn;"
and from the opening of the tent of meeting ye go not out seven days
as he hath done on this day
and at the opening of the tent of meeting ye abide
And Aaron doth -- his sons also -- all the things which Jehovah hath commanded by the hand of Moses."
