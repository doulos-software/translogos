And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`When a man hath in the skin of his flesh a rising
and the priest hath seen the plague in the skin of the flesh
`And if the bright spot is white in the skin of his flesh
`And the priest hath seen him on the seventh day
`And the priest hath seen him on the second seventh day
`And if the scab spread greatly in the skin
and the priest hath seen
`When a plague of leprosy is in a man
and the priest hath seen
an old leprosy it `is' in the skin of his flesh
`And if the leprosy break out greatly in the skin
then hath the priest seen
`And in the day of raw flesh being seen in him he is unclean;"
and the priest hath seen the raw flesh
Or when the raw flesh turneth back
and the priest hath seen him
`And when flesh hath in it
and there hath been in the place of the ulcer a white rising
and the priest hath seen
`And if the priest see it
and if it spread greatly in the skin
and if in its place the bright spot stay -- it hath not spread -- it `is' an inflammation of the ulcer; and the priest hath pronounced him clean."
`Or when flesh hath in its skin a fiery burning
and the priest hath seen it
`And if the priest see it
and the priest hath seen him on the seventh day
`And if the bright spot stay in its place
`And when a man (or a woman) hath in him a plague in the head or in the beard
then hath the priest seen the plague
`And when the priest seeth the plague of the scall
`And the priest hath seen the plague on the seventh day
then he hath shaved himself
And the priest hath seen the scall on the seventh day
`And if the scall spread greatly in the skin after his cleansing
and the priest hath seen him
and if in his eyes the scall hath stayed
`And when a man or woman hath in the skin of their flesh bright spots
and the priest hath seen
`And when a man's head `is' polished
and if from the corner of his face his head is polished
`And when there is in the bald back of the head
and the priest hath seen him
he `is' a leprous man
`As to the leper in whom `is' the plague
all the days that the plague `is' in him he is unclean; he `is' unclean
`And when there is in any garment a plague of leprosy
or in the warp
and the plague hath been very green or very red in the garment
`And the priest hath seen the plague
and he hath seen the plague on the seventh day
`And he hath burnt the garment
`And if the priest see
then hath the priest commanded
And the priest hath seen `that which hath' the plague after it hath been washed
`And if the priest hath seen
and if it still be seen in the garment
`And the garment
`This `is' the law of a plague of leprosy `in' a garment of wool or of linen
