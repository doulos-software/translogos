And the sons of Aaron
and fire goeth out from before Jehovah
And Moses saith unto Aaron
And Moses calleth unto Mishael and unto Elzaphan
and they come near
And Moses saith unto Aaron
and from the opening of the tent of meeting ye do not go out
And Jehovah speaketh unto Aaron
`Wine and strong drink thou dost not drink
so as to make a separation between the holy and the common
and to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.'"
And Moses speaketh unto Aaron
and ye have eaten it in the holy place
`And the breast of the wave-offering
the leg of the heave-offering
And the goat of the sin-offering hath Moses diligently sought
`Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the holy place
lo
And Aaron speaketh unto Moses
And Moses hearkeneth
