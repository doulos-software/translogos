And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`This is a law of the leper
and the priest hath gone out unto the outside of the camp
and the priest hath commanded
`And the priest hath commanded
`as to' the living bird
and he hath sprinkled on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times
`And he who is to be cleansed hath washed his garments
`And it hath been
`And on the eighth day he taketh two lambs
`And the priest who is cleansing hath caused the man who is to be cleansed to stand with them before Jehovah
and the priest hath taken the one he-lamb
`And he hath slaughtered the lamb in the place where he slaughtereth the sin-offering and the burnt-offering
`And the priest hath taken of the blood of the guilt-offering
and the priest hath taken of the log of oil
and the priest hath dipped his right finger in the oil which `is' on his left palm
`And of the residue of the oil which `is' on his palm
and the remnant of the oil which `is' on the palm of the priest
`And the priest hath made the sin-offering
and the priest hath caused the burnt-offering to ascend
`And if he `is' poor
and two turtle-doves
and he hath brought them in on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest
`And the priest hath taken the lamb of the guilt-offering
and he hath slaughtered the lamb of the guilt-offering
and the priest doth pour of the oil on the left palm of the priest;"
and the priest hath sprinkled with his right finger of the oil which `is' on his left palm
`And the priest hath put of the oil which `is' on his palm
and the remnant of the oil which `is' on the palm of the priest he doth put on the head of him who is to be cleansed
`And he hath made the one of the turtle-doves
`even' that which his hand reacheth to)
This `is' a law of him in whom `is' a plague of leprosy
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`When ye come in unto the land of Canaan
then hath he whose the house `is' come in and declared to the priest
and the priest hath commanded
and he hath seen the plague
and the priest hath gone out of the house unto the opening of the house
`And the priest hath turned back on the seventh day
and the priest hath commanded
and the house he doth cause to be scraped within round about
and they have taken other stones
`And if the plague return
then hath the priest come in and seen
`And he hath broken down the house
`And he who is going in unto the house all the days he hath shut it up
and he who is lying in the house doth wash his garments; and he who is eating in the house doth wash his garments."
`And if the priest certainly come in
`And he hath taken for the cleansing of the house two birds
and he hath slaughtered the one bird upon an earthen vessel
and he hath taken the cedar wood
`And he hath cleansed the house with the blood of the bird
and he hath sent away the living bird unto the outside of the city unto the face of the field
`This `is' the law for every plague of the leprosy and for scall
and for leprosy of a garment
and for a rising
to direct in the day of being unclean
