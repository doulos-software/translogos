And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
and this is his uncleanness in his issue -- his flesh hath run with his issue
`All the bed on which he lieth who hath the issue is unclean
and any one who cometh against his bed doth wash his garments
`And he who is sitting on the vessel on which he sitteth who hath the issue
`And he who is coming against the flesh of him who hath the issue
`And when he who hath the issue spitteth on him who is clean
`And all the saddle on which he rideth who hath the issue is unclean;"
and any one who is coming against anything which is under him is unclean till the evening
`And anyone against whom he cometh who hath the issue (and his hands hath not rinsed with water) hath even washed his garments
`And the earthen vessel which he who hath the issue cometh against is broken; and every wooden vessel is rinsed with water."
`And when he who hath the issue is clean from his issue
`And on the eighth day he taketh to himself two turtle-doves
and the priest hath made them
`And when a man's seed of copulation goeth out from him
`And any garment
`And a woman with whom a man lieth with seed of copulation
`And when a woman hath an issue -- blood is her issue in her flesh -- seven days she is in her separation
`And anything on which she lieth in her separation is unclean
and any one who is coming against her bed doth wash his garments
`And any one who is coming against any vessel on which she sitteth doth wash his garments
`And if it `is' on the bed
`And if a man really lie with her
`And when a woman's issue of blood floweth many days within the time of her separation
`All the bed on which she lieth all the days of her issue is as the bed of her separation to her
and any one who is coming against them is unclean
`And if she hath been clean from her issue
and on the eighth day she taketh to herself two turtle-doves
and the priest hath made the one a sin-offering
`And ye have separated the sons of Israel from their uncleanness
`This `is' the law of him who hath an issue
and of her who is sick in her separation
