`Ye do not make to yourselves idols; and graven image or standing image ye do not set up to yourselves; and a stone of imagery ye do not put in your land
`My sabbaths ye do keep
`If in My statutes ye walk
then I have given your rains in their season
and reached to you hath the threshing
`And I have given peace in the land
`And ye have pursued your enemies
and five of you have pursued a hundred
`And I have turned unto you
and ye have eaten old `store'
`And I have given My tabernacle in your midst
and I have walked habitually in your midst
I `am' Jehovah your God
`And if ye do not hearken to Me
and if at My statutes ye kick
I also do this to you
and I have set My face against you
`And if unto these ye hearken not to Me
and I have broken the pride of your strength
and consumed hath been your strength in vain
`And if ye walk with Me `in' opposition
and sent against you the beast of the field
`And if by these ye are not instructed by Me
then I have walked -- I also -- with you in opposition
and I have brought in on you a sword
`In My breaking to you the staff of bread
`And if for this ye hearken not to Me
then I have walked with you in the fury of opposition
`And ye have eaten the flesh of your sons; even flesh of your daughters ye do eat."
And I have destroyed your high places
and I have made your cities a waste
and I have made desolate the land
And you I scatter among nations
`Then doth the land enjoy its sabbaths -- all the days of the desolation
all the days of the desolation it resteth that which it hath not rested in your sabbaths in your dwelling on it."
`And those who are left of you -- I have also brought a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies
And they have stumbled one on another
and ye have perished among the nations
`And those who are left of you -- they consume away in their iniquity
`And -- they have confessed their iniquity
also I walk to them in opposition
then I have remembered My covenant `with' Jacob
`And -- the land is left of them
and also even this
then I have remembered for them the covenant of the ancestors
These `are' the statutes
