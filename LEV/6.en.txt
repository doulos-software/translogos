And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`When any person doth sin
or hath found a lost thing
`Then it hath been
or all that concerning which he sweareth falsely
`And his guilt-offering he bringeth in to Jehovah
and the priest hath made atonement for him before Jehovah
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Command Aaron and his sons
that the priest hath put on his long robe of fine linen
and he hath stripped off his garments
`And the fire on the altar is burning on it
fire is continually burning on the altar
`And this `is' a law of the present: sons of Aaron have brought it near before Jehovah unto the front of the altar
and `one' hath lifted up of it with his hand from the flour of the present
`And the remnant of it do Aaron and his sons eat; `with' unleavened things it is eaten
It is not baken `with' any thing fermented
Every male among the sons of Aaron doth eat it -- a statute age-during to your generations
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`This `is' an offering of Aaron and of his sons
on a girdel with oil it is made -- fried thou dost bring it in; baked pieces of the present thou dost bring near
`And the priest who is anointed in his stead
and every present of a priest is a whole burnt-offering; it is not eaten.'"
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons
`The priest who is making atonement with it doth eat it
all that cometh against its flesh is holy
and an earthen vessel in which it is boiled is broken
`Every male among the priests doth eat it -- it `is' most holy;"
and no sin-offering
