And it cometh to pass on the eighth day
and he saith unto Aaron
`And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak
and a bullock and a ram for peace-offerings
And they take that which Moses hath commanded unto the front of the tent of meeting
and Moses saith
And Moses saith unto Aaron
And Aaron draweth near unto the altar
and the sons of Aaron bring the blood near unto him
and the fat
and the flesh and the skin he hath burnt with fire
And he slaughtereth the burnt-offering
and the burnt-offering they have presented unto him
and he washeth the inwards and the legs
And he bringeth near the offering of the people
and he bringeth near the burnt-offering
and he bringeth near the present
And he slaughtereth the bullock and the ram
and the fat of the bullock
and they set the fat on the breasts
and the breasts
And Aaron lifteth up his hand towards the people
And Moses goeth in -- Aaron also -- unto the tent of meeting
and fire cometh out from before Jehovah
