And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
yea
`With this doth Aaron come in unto the sanctuary; with a bullock
a holy linen coat he putteth on
`And from the company of the sons of Israel he taketh two kids of the goats for a sin-offering
and Aaron hath brought near the bullock of the sin-offering which is his own
and he hath taken the two goats
`And Aaron hath given lots over the two goats
and Aaron hath brought near the goat on which the lot for Jehovah hath gone up
`And the goat on which the lot for a goat of departure hath gone up is caused to stand living before Jehovah to make atonement by it
`And Aaron hath brought near the bullock of the sin-offering which is his own
and hath taken the fulness of the censer of burning coals of fire from off the altar
and he hath put the perfume on the fire before Jehovah
`And he hath taken of the blood of the bullock
`And he hath slaughtered the goat of the sin-offering which `is' the people's
and he hath made atonement for the sanctuary because of the uncleanness of the sons of Israel
`And no man is in the tent of meeting in his going in to make atonement in the sanctuary
`And he hath gone out unto the altar which `is' before Jehovah
and he hath sprinkled on it of the blood with his finger seven times
`And he hath ceased from making atonement `for' the sanctuary
and Aaron hath laid his two hands on the head of the living goat
and the goat hath borne on him all their iniquities unto a land of separation. `And he hath sent the goat away into the wilderness
and Aaron hath come in unto the tent of meeting
and he hath bathed his flesh with water in the holy place
and with the fat of the sin-offering he doth make perfume on the altar."
`And he who is sending away the goat for a goat of departure doth wash his garments
`And the bullock of the sin-offering
and he who is burning them doth wash his garments
`And it hath been to you for a statute age-during
for on this day he maketh atonement for you
it `is' to you a sabbath of rest
`And the priest whom he doth anoint
and he hath made atonement `for' the holy sanctuary; and `for' the tent of meeting
`And this hath been to you for a statute age-during
