`And if his offering `is' a sacrifice of peace-offerings
and he hath laid his hand on the head of his offering
`And he hath brought near from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings a fire-offering to Jehovah
and the two kidneys
and sons of Aaron have made it a perfume on the altar
`And if his offering `is' out of the flock for a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Jehovah
if a sheep he is bringing near `for' his offering
and hath laid his hand on the head of his offering
`And he hath brought near from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings a fire-offering to Jehovah
and the two kidneys
and the priest hath made it a perfume on the altar -- bread of a fire-offering to Jehovah."
`And if his offering `is' a goat
and hath laid his hand on its head
and he hath brought near from it his offering
and the two kidneys
and the priest hath made them a perfume on the altar -- bread of a fire-offering
`A statute age-during to your generations in all your dwellings: any fat or any blood ye do not eat.'"
