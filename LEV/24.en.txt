And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Command the sons of Israel
at the outside of the vail of the testimony in the tent of meeting doth Aaron arrange it from evening till morning before Jehovah continually -- a statute age-during to your generations;"
by the pure candlestick he doth arrange the lights before Jehovah continually."
`And thou hast taken flour
and thou hast set them two ranks (six in the rank) on the pure table before Jehovah
and thou hast put on the rank pure frankincense
`On each sabbath-day he arrangeth it before Jehovah continually
and it hath been to Aaron
And a son of an Israelitish woman goeth out (and he `is' son of an Egyptian man)
and the son of the Israelitish woman execrateth the Name
and he causeth him to rest in charge -- to explain to them by the mouth of Jehovah."
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Bring out the reviler unto the outside of the camp; and all those hearing have laid their hands on his head
`And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak
and he who is execrating the name of Jehovah is certainly put to death; all the company do certainly cast stones at him; as a sojourner so a native
`And when a man smiteth any soul of man
`And he who smiteth a beast repayeth it
`And when a man putteth a blemish in his fellow
breach for breach
`And he who smiteth a beast repayeth it
one judgment is to you; as a sojourner so is a native; for I `am' Jehovah your God.'"
And Moses speaketh unto the sons of Israel
