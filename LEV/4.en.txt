And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
`If the priest who is anointed doth sin according to the guilt of the people
and he hath brought in the bullock unto the opening of the tent of meeting before Jehovah
`And the priest who is anointed hath taken of the blood of the bullock
and the priest hath dipped his finger in the blood
and the priest hath put of the blood on the horns of the altar of spice-perfume before Jehovah
`And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering he doth lift up from it
and the two kidneys
as it is lifted up from the ox of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings; and the priest hath made them a perfume on the altar of the burnt-offering."
`And the skin of the bullock
he hath even brought out the whole bullock unto the outside of the camp
`And if the whole company of Israel err ignorantly
when the sin which they have sinned concerning it hath been known
and the elders of the company have laid their hands on the head of the bullock
`And the priest who is anointed hath brought in of the blood of the bullock unto the tent of meeting
and the priest hath dipped his finger in the blood
and `some' of the blood he doth put on the horns of the altar which `is' before Jehovah
and all its fat he doth lift up from it
`And he hath done to the bullock as he hath done to the bullock of the sin-offering
and he hath brought out the bullock unto the outside of the camp
`When a prince doth sin
or his sin wherein he hath sinned hath been made known unto him
and he hath laid his hand on the head of the goat
`And the priest hath taken of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger
and with all its fat he doth make perfume on the altar
`And if any person of the people of the land sin through ignorance
or his sin which he hath sinned hath been made known unto him
and he hath laid his hand on the head of the sin-offering
`And the priest hath taken of its blood with his finger
and all its fat he doth turn aside
`And if he bring in a sheep `for' his offering
and he hath laid his hand on the head of the sin-offering
`And the priest hath taken of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger
and all its fat he turneth aside
