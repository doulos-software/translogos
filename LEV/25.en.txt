And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
`Six years thou dost sow thy field
and in the seventh year a sabbath of rest is to the land
the spontaneous growth of thy harvest thou dost not reap
`And the sabbath of the land hath been to you for food
and to thy cattle
`And thou hast numbered to thee seven sabbaths of years
and thou hast caused a trumpet of shouting to pass over in the seventh month
and ye have hallowed the year
`A jubilee it `is'
for a jubilee it `is'
in the year of this jubilee ye turn back each unto his possession."
`And when thou sellest anything to thy fellow
by the number of years after the jubilee thou dost buy from thy fellow; by the number of the years of increase he doth sell to thee;"
according to the multitude of the years thou dost multiply its price
and ye do not oppress one another
`And ye have done My statutes
and the land hath given its fruit
`And when ye say
then I have commanded My blessing on you in the sixth year
and ye have sown the eighth year
`And the land is not sold -- to extinction
and in all the land of your possession a redemption ye do give to the land."
`When thy brother becometh poor
and when a man hath no redeemer
then he hath reckoned the years of its sale
`And if his hand hath not found sufficiency to give back to him
`And when a man selleth a dwelling-house `in' a walled city
and if it is not redeemed until the fulness to him of a perfect year
and a house of the villages which have no wall round about
`As to cities of the Levites -- houses of the cities of their possession -- redemption age-during is to the Levites;"
as to him who redeemeth from the Levites
And a field
`And when thy brother is become poor
thou takest no usury from him
thy money thou givest not to him in usury
I `am' Jehovah your God
`And when thy brother becometh poor with thee
as an hireling
then he hath gone out from thee
`For they `are' My servants
thou rulest not over him with rigour
`And thy man-servant and thy handmaid whom thou hast `are' of the nations who `are' round about you; of them ye buy man-servant and handmaid
and also of the sons of the settlers who are sojourning with you
and ye have taken them for inheritance to your sons after you
`And when the hand of a sojourner or settler with thee attaineth `riches'
after he hath been sold
or his uncle
`And he hath reckoned with his buyer from the year of his being sold to him till the year of jubilee
`If yet many years
`And if few are left of the years till the year of jubilee
as an hireling
`And if he is not redeemed in these `years'
For to Me `are' the sons of Israel servants; My servants they `are'
