And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
any dividing a hoof
`Only
and the rabbit
and the hare
and the sow
`Of their flesh ye do not eat
`This ye do eat of all which `are' in the waters; any one that hath fins and scales in the waters
and any one that hath not fins and scales in the seas
yea
`Any one that hath not fins and scales in the waters -- an abomination it `is' to you."
`And these ye do abominate of the fowl; they are not eaten
and the vulture
every raven after its kind
and the owl
and the little owl
and the swan
and the stork
`Every teeming creature which is flying
`Only -- this ye do eat of any teeming thing which is flying
these of them ye do eat: the locust after its kind
and every teeming thing which is flying
`And by these ye are made unclean
and anyone who is lifting up `aught' of their carcase doth wash his garments
even every beast which is dividing the hoof
`And any one going on its paws
and he who is lifting up their carcase doth wash his garments
`And this `is' to you the unclean among the teeming things which are teeming on the earth: the weasel
and the ferret
these `are' the unclean to you among all which are teeming; any one who is coming against them in their death is unclean till the evening."
`And anything on which any one of them falleth
and any earthen vessel
`Of all the food which is eaten
and anything on which `any' of their carcase falleth is unclean (oven or double pots)
`Only -- a fountain or pit
and when `any' of their carcase falleth on any sown seed which is sown -- it `is' clean;"
and when water is put on the seed
`And when any of the beasts which are to you for food dieth
and he who is eating of its carcase doth wash his garments
`And every teeming thing which is teeming on the earth is an abomination
any thing going on the belly
ye do not make yourselves abominable with any teeming thing which is teeming
`For I `am' Jehovah your God
for I `am' Jehovah who am bringing you up out of the land of Egypt to become your God; and ye have been holy
`This `is' a law of the beasts
to make separation between the unclean and the pure
