`And when a person doth sin
`Or when a person cometh against any thing unclean
`Or when he cometh against uncleanness of man
`Or when a person sweareth
`And it hath been when he is guilty of one of these
and hath brought in his guilt-offering to Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned
`And if his hand reach not to the sufficiency of a lamb
and he hath brought them in unto the priest
and he hath sprinkled of the blood of the sin-offering on the side of the altar
`And the second he maketh a burnt-offering
`And if his hand reach not to two turtle-doves
and he hath brought it in unto the priest
`And the priest hath made atonement for him
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`When a person committeth a trespass
`And that which he hath sinned against the holy thing he repayeth
`And when any person sinneth
`Then he hath brought in a ram
it `is' a guilt-offering; he hath been certainly guilty before Jehovah.'"
