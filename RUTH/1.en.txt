And it cometh to pass
And the name of the man `is' Elimelech
And Elimelech husband of Naomi dieth
and they take to them wives
And they die also
And she riseth
And she goeth out from the place where she hath been
And Naomi saith to her two daughters-in-law
Jehovah doth grant to you
And they say to her
And Naomi saith
Turn back
for them do ye wait till that they grow up? for them do ye shut yourselves up
And they lift up their voice
And she saith
And Ruth saith
Where thou diest I die
And she seeth that she is strengthening herself to go with her
and they go both of them till their coming in to Beth-Lehem; and it cometh to pass at their coming in to Beth-Lehem
And she saith unto them
I went out full
And Naomi turneth back
