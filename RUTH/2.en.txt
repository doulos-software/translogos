And Naomi hath an acquaintance of her husband's
And Ruth the Moabitess saith unto Naomi
And she goeth and cometh and gathereth in a field after the reapers
And lo
And Boaz saith to his young man who is set over the reapers
And the young man who is set over the reapers answereth and saith
and she saith
And Boaz saith unto Ruth
thine eyes `are' on the field which they reap
And she falleth on her face
And Boaz answereth and saith to her
Jehovah doth recompense thy work
And she saith
And Boaz saith to her
And she riseth to glean
and also ye do surely cast to her of the handfuls -- and have left
And she gleaneth in the field till the evening
and she taketh `it' up
And her mother-in-law saith to her
And Naomi saith to her daughter-in-law
And Ruth the Moabitess saith
And Naomi saith unto Ruth her daughter-in-law
And she cleaveth to the young women of Boaz to glean
