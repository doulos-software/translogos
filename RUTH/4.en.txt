And Boaz hath gone up to the gate
And he taketh ten men of the elders of the city
And he saith to the redeemer
and I said
And Boaz saith
And the redeemer saith
And this `is' formerly in Israel for redemption and for changing
And the redeemer saith to Boaz
And Boaz saith to the elders
and also Ruth the Moabitess
And all the people who `are' in the gate say -- also the elders -- `Witnesses! Jehovah make the woman who is coming in unto thy house as Rachel and as Leah
and let thy house be as the house of Pharez (whom Tamar bare to Judah)
And Boaz taketh Ruth
And the women say unto Naomi
and he hath been to thee for a restorer of life
And Naomi taketh the lad
and the neighbouring women give to him a name
And these are genealogies of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron
and Hezron begat Ram
and Amminidab begat Nahshon
and Salmon begat Boaz
and Obed begat Jesse
