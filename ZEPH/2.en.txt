Bend yourselves
Before the bringing forth of a statute
Seek Jehovah
For Gaza is forsaken
Ho! O inhabitants of the sea-coast
And the sea-coast hath been habitations
And the coast hath been for the remnant of the house of Judah
I have heard the reproach of Moab
Therefore
This `is' to them for their arrogancy
Fearful `is' Jehovah against them
Also ye
And He stretcheth His hand against the north
And crouched in her midst have droves
This `is' the exulting city that is dwelling confidently
