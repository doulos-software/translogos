Wo `to' the rebellious and polluted
She hath not hearkened to the voice
Her heads in her midst `are' roaring lions
Her prophets unstable -- men of treachery
Jehovah `is' righteous in her midst
I have cut off nations
I have said: Only
Therefore
For then do I turn unto peoples a pure lip
From beyond the rivers of Cush
In that day thou art not ashamed because of any of thine actions
And I have left in thy midst a people humble and poor
The remnant of Israel do no perversity
Cry aloud
Jehovah hath turned aside thy judgments
In that day it is said to Jerusalem
Jehovah thy God `is' in thy midst
Mine afflicted from the appointed place I have gathered
Lo
At that time I bring you in
