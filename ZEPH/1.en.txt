A word of Jehovah that hath been unto Zephaniah son of Cushi
I utterly consume all from off the face of the ground
I consume man and beast
And stretched out My hand against Judah
And those bowing themselves On the roofs to the host of the heavens
And those removing from after Jehovah
Hush! because of the Lord Jehovah
And it hath come to pass
And I have laid a charge on every one Who is leaping over the threshold in that day
And there hath been in that day
Howl
And it hath come to pass
And their wealth hath been for a spoil
Near `is' the great day of Jehovah
A day of wrath `is' that day
A day of trumpet and shouting against the fenced cities
And I have sent distress to men
Even their silver
