Lo
And each hath been as a hiding-place `from' wind
And not dazzled are the eyes of beholders
And the heart of those hastened Understandeth to know
A fool is no more called `noble
For a fool speaketh folly
And the miser -- his instruments `are' evil
And the noble counselled noble things
Women
Days and a year ye are troubled
Tremble ye women
For breasts they are lamenting
Over the ground of my people thorn -- brier goeth up
Surely the palace hath been left
Till emptied out on us is the Spirit from on high
And dwelt in the wilderness hath judgment
And a work of the righteousness hath been peace
And dwelt hath My people in a peaceful habitation
And it hath hailed in the going down of the forest
Happy `are' ye sowing by all waters
