I have been inquired of by those who asked not
I have spread out My hands all the day Unto an apostate people
The people who are provoking Me to anger
Who are dwelling among sepulchres
Who are saying
Lo
Your iniquities
Thus said Jehovah: As the new wine is found in the cluster
And I have brought out from Jacob a seed
And Sharon hath been for the habitation of a flock
And ye `are' those forsaking Jehovah
And I have numbered you for the sword
Therefore
Lo
And ye have left your name For an oath for My chosen ones
So that he who is blessing himself in the earth
For
But joy ye
And I have rejoiced in Jerusalem
There is not thence any more a suckling of days
And they have built houses
They do not build
They labour not for a vain thing
And it hath come to pass
Wolf and lamb do feed as one
