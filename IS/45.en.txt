Thus said Jehovah
`I go before thee
And have given to thee treasures of darkness
For the sake of my servant Jacob
I `am' Jehovah
So that they know from the rising of the sun
Forming light
Drop
Wo `to' him who is striving with his Former
Wo `to' him who is saying to a father
Thus said Jehovah
I made earth
I have stirred him up in righteousness
Thus said Jehovah
Surely Thou `art' a God hiding Thyself
They have been ashamed
Israel hath been saved in Jehovah
For thus said Jehovah
Not in secret have I spoken
Be gathered
Declare ye
Turn to Me
By Myself I have sworn
Only in Jehovah
In Jehovah are all the seed of Israel justified
