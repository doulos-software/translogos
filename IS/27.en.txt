In that day lay a charge doth Jehovah
In that day
I
Fury is not in Me; Who giveth Me a brier -- a thorn in battle? I step into it
Or -- he doth take hold on My strength
Those coming in He causeth to take root
As the smiting of his smiter hath He smitten him? As the slaying of his slain doth He slay?"
In measure
Therefore by this is the iniquity of Jacob covered
For the fenced city `is' alone
In the withering of its branch it is broken off
And it hath come to pass
And it hath come to pass
