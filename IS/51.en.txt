Hearken unto Me
Look attentively unto Abraham your father
For Jehovah hath comforted Zion
Attend unto Me
Near `is' My righteousness
Lift ye up to the heavens your eyes
Hearken unto Me
For as a garment eat them doth a moth
Awake
Art not Thou it that is drying up a sea
And the ransomed of Jehovah turn back
I -- I `am' He -- your comforter
And thou dost forget Jehovah thy maker
Hastened hath a wanderer to be loosed
And I `am' Jehovah thy God
And I put My words in thy mouth
Stir thyself
There is not a leader to her Out of all the sons she hath borne
These two are meeting thee
Thy sons have been wrapt up
Therefore
Thus said thy Lord Jehovah
And I have put it into the hand of those afflicting thee
