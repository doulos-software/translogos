And it cometh to pass
And the king of Asshur sendeth Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem
and go forth unto him doth Eliakim son of Hilkiah
And Rabshakeh saith unto them
I have said: Only
`Lo
`And dost thou say unto me
`And now
And how dost thou turn back the face of one captain of the least of the servants of my lord
And now
And Eliakim saith -- and Shebna and Joah -- unto Rabshakeh
And Rabshakeh saith
And Rabshakeh standeth and calleth with a great voice `in' Jewish
Thus said the king
and let not Hezekiah make you trust unto Jehovah
`Do not hearken unto Hezekiah
till my coming in
lest Hezekiah doth persuade you
Where `are' the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where the gods of Sepharvaim
Who among all the gods of these lands `are' they who have delivered their land out of my hand
And they keep silent
And Eliakim son of Hilkiah
