The burden of Damascus. Lo
Forsaken are the cities of Aroer
And ceased hath the fortress from Ephraim
And it hath come to pass
And it hath come to pass
And left in him have been gleanings
In that day doth man look to His Maker
And he looketh not unto the altars. The work of his own hands
In that day are the cities of his strength As the forsaken thing of the forest
Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation
In the day thy plant thou causest to become great
Wo `to' the multitude of many peoples
Nations as the wasting of many waters are wasted
At even-time
