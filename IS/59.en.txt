Lo
But your iniquities have been separating Between you and your God
For your hands have been polluted with blood
There is none calling in righteousness
Eggs of a viper they have hatched
Their webs become not a garment
Their feet to evil do run
A way of peace they have not known
Therefore hath judgment been far from us
We feel like the blind `for' the wall
We make a noise as bears -- all of us
For our transgressions have been multiplied before Thee
Transgressing
And removed backward is judgment
And the truth is lacking
And He seeth that there is no man
And He putteth on righteousness as a breastplate
According to deeds -- so He repayeth. Fury to His adversaries
And they fear from the west the name of Jehovah
And come to Zion hath a redeemer
And I -- this `is' My covenant with them
