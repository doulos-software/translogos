Come near
For wrath `is' to Jehovah against all the nations
And their wounded are cast out
And consumed have been all the host of the heavens
For soaked in the heavens was My sword
A sword `is' to Jehovah -- it hath been full of blood
And come down have reems with them
(For a day of vengeance `is' to Jehovah
And turned have been her streams to pitch
By night and by day she is not quenched
And possess her do pelican and hedge-hog
`To' the kingdom her freemen they call
And gone up her palaces have thorns
And met have Ziim with Aiim
There made her nest hath the bittern
Seek out of the book of Jehovah
And He hath cast for them a lot
