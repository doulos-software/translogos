The Burden of Tyre. Howl
Be silent
And in many waters `is' the seed of Sihor
Be ashamed
As `at' the report of Egypt they are pained
Pass over to Tarshish
Is this your exulting one? From the days of old `is' her antiquity
Who hath counselled this against Tyre
Jehovah of Hosts hath counselled it
Pass through thy land as a brook
His hand He hath stretched out over the sea
And He saith
Lo
Howl
And it hath come to pass
Take a harp
And it hath come to pass
And her merchandise and her gift have been holy to Jehovah
