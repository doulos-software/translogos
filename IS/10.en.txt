Wo `to' those decreeing decrees of iniquity
To turn aside from judgment the poor
And what do ye at a day of inspection? And at desolation? -- from afar it cometh. Near whom do ye flee for help? And where do ye leave your honour?"
Without Me it hath bowed down In the place of a bound one
Wo `to' Asshur
Against a profane nation I send him
And he -- he thinketh not so
For he saith
Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not Samaria as Damascus?"
As my hand hath got to the kingdoms of a worthless thing
Do I not -- as I have done to Samaria
And it hath come to pass
For he hath said
And my hand as to a nest Getteth to the wealth of the peoples
-- Doth the axe glorify itself Against him who is hewing with it? Doth the saw magnify itself Against him who is shaking it? As a rod waving those lifting it up! As a staff lifting up that which is not wood!"
Therefore doth the Lord
And the light of Israel hath been for a fire
And the honour of his forest
And the rest of the trees of his forest `are' few
And it hath come to pass
A remnant returneth -- a remnant of Jacob
For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea
For a consumption that is determined
Therefore
For yet a very little
And awaking for him is Jehovah of Hosts
And it hath come to pass
He hath come in against Aiath
They have gone over the passage
Cry aloud `with' thy voice
Fled away hath Madmenah
Yet to-day in Nob to remain
Lo
And He hath gone round the thickets of the forest with iron
