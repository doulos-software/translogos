And it cometh to pass in the days of Ahaz
And it is declared to the house of David
And Jehovah saith unto Isaiah
and thou hast said unto him: `Take heed
Because that Aram counselled against thee evil
We go up into Judah
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: It doth not stand
For the head of Aram `is' Damascus
And the head of Ephraim `is' Samaria
And Jehovah addeth to speak unto Ahaz
`Ask for thee a sign from Jehovah thy God
And Ahaz saith
And he saith
Therefore the Lord Himself giveth to you a sign
Butter and honey he doth eat
For before the youth doth know To refuse evil
Jehovah bringeth on thee
And it hath come to pass
And they have come
In that day doth the Lord shave
And it hath come to pass
And it hath come to pass
And it hath come to pass
With arrows and with bow he cometh thither
And all the hills that with a mattock are kept in order
