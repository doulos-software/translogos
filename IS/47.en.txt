Come down
Take millstones
Revealed is thy nakedness
Our redeemer `is' Jehovah of Hosts
Sit silent
I have been wroth against My people
And thou sayest
And now
And come in to thee do these two things
And thou art confident in thy wickedness
And come in on thee hath evil
Stand
Thou hast been wearied in the multitude of thy counsels
Lo
So have they been to thee with whom thou hast laboured
