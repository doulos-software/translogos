And it cometh to pass
and sendeth Eliakim
and they say unto him
`It may be Jehovah thy God doth hear the words of Rabshakeh with which the king of Asshur his lord hath sent him to reproach the living God
And the servants of king Hezekiah come in unto Isaiah
and Isaiah saith unto them
Lo
And Rabshakeh turneth back and findeth the king of Asshur fighting against Libnah
And he heareth concerning Tirhakah king of Cush
`Thus do ye speak unto Hezekiah king of Judah
Lo
Did the gods of the nations deliver them whom my fathers destroyed -- Gozan
Where `is' the king of Hamath
And Hezekiah taketh the letters out of the hand of the messengers
And Hezekiah prayeth unto Jehovah
`Jehovah of Hosts
Incline
`Truly
so as to put their gods into fire -- for they `are' no gods
And now
And Isaiah son of Amoz sendeth unto Hezekiah
this `is' the word that Jehovah spake concerning him: Trampled on thee
Whom hast thou reproached and reviled? And against whom lifted up the voice? Yea
By the hand of thy servants Thou hast reviled the Lord
I -- I have dug and drunk waters
Hast thou not heard from afar? -- it I did
And their inhabitants are feeble-handed
And thy sitting down
Because of thy anger towards Me
-- And this to thee `is' the sign
And it hath continued -- the escaped Of the house of Judah that hath been left -- To take root beneath
For from Jerusalem goeth forth a remnant
Therefore
In the way that he came
And I have covered over this city
And a messenger of Jehovah goeth out
And journey
And it cometh to pass
