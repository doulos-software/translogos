The righteous hath perished
He entereth into peace
And ye
Against whom do ye sport yourselves? Against whom enlarge ye the mouth? Prolong ye the tongue? Are not ye children of transgression? a false seed?"
Who are inflamed among oaks
Among the smooth things of a brook `is' thy portion
On a mountain
And behind the door
And goest joyfully to the king in ointment
In the greatness of thy way thou hast laboured
And of whom hast thou been afraid
I declare thy righteousness
When thou criest
And he hath said
For thus said the high and exalted One
For
For the iniquity of his dishonest gain
His ways I have seen
Producing the fruit of the lips
And the wicked `are' as the driven out sea
There is no peace
