And Jehovah saith unto me
And I cause faithful witnesses to testify to me
And I draw near unto the prophetess
for before the youth doth know to cry
And Jehovah addeth to speak unto me again
`Because that this people hath refused The waters of Shiloah that go softly
Therefore
And it hath passed on into Judah
Be friends
Take counsel
For thus hath Jehovah spoken unto me with strength of hand
`Ye do not say
Jehovah of Hosts -- Him ye do sanctify
And He hath been for a sanctuary
And many among them have stumbled and fallen
Bind up the testimony
And I have waited for Jehovah
Lo
And when they say unto you
To the law and to the testimony! If not
-- And it hath passed over into it
And unto the land it looketh attentively
