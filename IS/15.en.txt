The burden of Moab. Because in a night destroyed was Ar of Moab -- It hath been cut off
He hath gone up to Bajith and Dibon
In its out-places they girded on sackcloth
And cry doth Heshbon and Elealeh
My heart `is' toward Moab
For
Therefore the abundance he made
For gone round hath the cry the border of Moab
For the waters of Dimon have been full of blood
