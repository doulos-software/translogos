The Visions of Isaiah son of Amoz
Hear
An ox hath known its owner
Ah
Wherefore are ye stricken any more? Ye do add apostacy! Every head is become diseased
From the sole of the foot -- unto the head
Your land `is' a desolation
And left hath been the daughter of Zion
Unless Jehovah of Hosts had left to us a remnant
Hear the word of Jehovah
`Why to Me the abundance of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah
When ye come in to appear before Me
Add not to bring in a vain present
Your new moons and your set seasons hath My soul hated
And in your spreading forth your hands
Wash ye
Seek judgment
Come
If ye are willing
And if ye refuse
How hath a faithful city become a harlot? I have filled it `with' judgment
Thy silver hath become dross
Thy princes `are' apostates
Therefore -- the affirmation of the Lord -- Jehovah of Hosts
And I turn back My hand upon thee
And I give back thy judges as at the first
Zion in judgment is redeemed
And the destruction of transgressors and sinners `is' together
For `men' are ashamed because of the oaks That ye have desired
For ye are as an oak whose leaf is fading
And the strong hath been for tow
