Arise
For
And come have nations to thy light
Lift up round about thine eyes and see
Then thou seest
A company of camels covereth thee
All the flock of Kedar are gathered to thee
Who `are' these -- as a thick cloud they fly
Surely for Me isles do wait
And sons of a stranger have built thy walls
And opened have thy gates continually
For the nation and the kingdom that do not serve thee perish
The honour of Lebanon unto thee doth come
And come unto thee
Instead of thy being forsaken and hated
And thou hast sucked the milk of nations
Instead of the brass I bring in gold
Violence is not heard any more in thy land
To thee no more is the sun for a light by day
Thy sun goeth no more in
And thy people `are' all of them righteous
The little one doth become a chief
