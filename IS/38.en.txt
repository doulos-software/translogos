In those days hath Hezekiah been sick unto death
And Hezekiah turneth round his face unto the wall
and saith
And a word of Jehovah is unto Isaiah
Go
and out of the hand of the king of Asshur I deliver thee and this city
And this `is' to thee the sign from Jehovah
Lo
A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah concerning his being sick
`I -- I said in the cutting off of my days
I said
My sojourning hath departed
I have set `Him' till morning as a lion
As a crane -- a swallow -- so I chatter
-- What do I say? seeing He said to me
Lord
Lo
For Sheol doth not confess Thee
The living
Like myself to-day -- a father to sons Doth make known of Thy faithfulness
And Isaiah saith
And Hezekiah saith
