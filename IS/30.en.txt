For the people in Zion dwell in Jerusalem
And the Lord hath given to you bread of adversity
And thine ear heareth a word behind thee
And ye have defiled the covering of Thy graven images of silver
And He hath given rain `for' thy seed
And the oxen and the young asses serving the ground
And there hath been on every high mount
And the light of the moon hath been as the light of the sun
Lo
And His breath `is' as an overflowing stream
Singing is to you as in a night sanctified for a festival
And caused to be heard hath Jehovah The honour of His voice
For from the voice of Jehovah broken down `is' Asshur
And every passage of the settled staff
