Lo
He doth not cry
A bruised reed he breaketh not
He doth not become weak nor bruised
Thus said God
I
To open the eyes of the blind
I `am' Jehovah
The former things
Sing to Jehovah a new song
The wilderness and its cities do lift up `the voice'
They ascribe to Jehovah honour
Jehovah as a mighty one goeth forth. As a man of war He stirreth up zeal
I have kept silent from of old
I make waste mountains and hills
And I have caused the blind to go
Removed backward -- utterly ashamed
Ye deaf
Who `is' blind but My servant? And deaf as My messenger I send? Who `is' blind as he who is at peace
Seeing many things
Jehovah hath delight for the sake of His righteousness
And this `is' a people seized and spoiled
Who among you giveth ear `to' this? Attendeth
Who hath given Jacob for a spoil
And He poureth on him fury
