The burden of the Valley of Vision. What -- to thee
Full of stirs -- a noisy city -- an exulting city
All thy rulers fled together from the bow
Therefore I said
For a day of noise
And Elam hath borne a quiver
And it cometh to pass
And one removeth the covering of Judah
And the breaches of the city of David ye have seen
And the houses of Jerusalem ye did number
And a ditch ye made between the two walls
And call doth the Lord
And lo
And revealed it hath been in mine ears
Thus said the Lord
What -- to thee here? And who -- to thee here? That thou hast hewn out to thee here -- a sepulchre? Hewing on high his sepulchre
Lo
And thy coverer covering
And I have thrust thee from thy station
And it hath come to pass
And I have clothed him with thy coat
And I have placed the key Of the house of David on his shoulder
And I have fixed him a nail in a stedfast place
And they have hanged on him All the honour of the house of his father
In that day -- an affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts
