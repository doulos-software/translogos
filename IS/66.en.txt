Thus said Jehovah: The heavens `are' My throne
And all these My hand hath made
Whoso slaughtereth the ox smiteth a man
I also -- I fix on their vexations
Hear a word of Jehovah
A voice of noise `is' from the city
Before she is pained she hath brought forth
Who hath heard anything like this? Who hath seen anything like these? Is earth caused to bring forth in one day? Born is a nation at once? For she hath been pained
`Do I bring to the birth
Rejoice ye with Jerusalem
So that ye suck
For thus said Jehovah: `Lo
As one whom his mother comforteth
And ye have seen
For
For by fire and by His sword
Those sanctifying and cleansing themselves at the gardens
And I -- their works and their thoughts
And I have set among them a sign
And they have brought all your brethren out of all the nations
And also of them I take for priests
For
And it hath been from month to month
And they have gone forth
