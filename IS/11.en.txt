And a rod hath come out from the stock of Jesse
Rested on him hath the Spirit of Jehovah
To refresh him in the fear of Jehovah
And he hath judged in righteousness the poor
And righteousness hath been the girdle of his loins
And a wolf hath sojourned with a lamb
And cow and bear do feed
And played hath a suckling by the hole of an asp
Evil they do not
And there hath been
And it hath come to pass
And He hath lifted up an ensign to nations
And turned aside hath the envy of Ephraim
And they have flown on the shoulder of the Philistines westward
And Jehovah hath devoted to destruction The tongue of the sea of Egypt
And there hath been a highway
