For
Hero and man of war
Head of fifty
And I have made youths their heads
And the people hath exacted -- man upon man
When one layeth hold on his brother
He lifteth up
For stumbled hath Jerusalem
The appearance of their faces witnessed against them
Say ye to the righteous
Wo to the wicked -- evil
My people -- its exactors `are' sucklings
Jehovah hath stood up to plead
Jehovah into judgment doth enter With elders of His people
What -- to you? ye bruise My people
`Because that daughters of Zion have been haughty
The Lord also hath scabbed The crown of the head of daughters of Zion
In that day doth the Lord turn aside The beauty of the tinkling ornaments
Of the drops
Of the bonnets
Of the seals
Of the costly apparel
Of the mirrors
And it hath been
For instead of glory
And lamented and mourned have her openings
