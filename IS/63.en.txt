`Who `is' this coming from Edom? With dyed garments from Bozrah? This that is honourable in his clothing
`Wherefore `is' thy clothing red? And thy garments as treading in a wine fat?'"
-- `A wine-press I have trodden by myself
For the day of vengeance `is' in my heart
And I look attentively
And I tread down peoples in mine anger
The kind acts of Jehovah I make mention of
And He saith
In all their distress `He is' no adversary
And they have rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit
And He remembereth the days of old
Leading by the right hand of Moses
Leading them through the depths
As a beast into a valley goeth down
Look attentively from the heavens
For Thou `art' our Father
Why causest Thou us to wander
For a little while did Thy holy people possess
We have been from of old
