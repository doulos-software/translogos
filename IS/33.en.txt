Wo
O Jehovah
From the voice of a multitude fled have peoples
And gathered hath been your spoil
Set on high is Jehovah
And hath been the stedfastness of thy times
Lo
Desolated have been highways
Mourned
Now
Ye conceive chaff
And peoples have been `as' burnings of lime
Hear
Afraid in Zion have been sinners
Whoso is walking righteously
He high places doth inhabit
A king in his beauty
Thy heart doth meditate terror
The strong people thou seest not
See Zion
But there mighty `is' Jehovah for us
For Jehovah our judge
Left have been thy ropes
Nor doth an inhabitant say
