The thing that Isaiah son of Amoz hath seen concerning Judah and Jerusalem:"
And it hath come to pass
And gone have many peoples and said
And He hath judged between the nations
O house of Jacob
For Thou hast left Thy people
And its land is full of silver and gold
And its land is full of idols
And the low boweth down
Enter into a rock
The haughty eyes of man have been humbled
For a day `is' to Jehovah of Hosts
And for all cedars of Lebanon
And for all the high mountains
And for every high tower
And for all ships of Tarshish
And bowed down hath been the haughtiness of man
And the idols -- they completely pass away."
And `men' have entered into caverns of rocks
In that day doth man cast his idols of silver
To enter into cavities of the rocks
Cease for you from man
