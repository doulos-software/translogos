Wo `to' those going down to Egypt for help
And He also `is' wise
And the Egyptians `are men'
For thus said Jehovah unto me: `As growl doth the lion and the young lion over his prey
As birds flying
Turn back to Him from whom sons of Israel Have deepened apostacy."
For in that day despise doth each His idols of silver
And fallen hath Asshur by sword
And `to' his rock from fear he passeth on
