As the former time made light The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali
The people who are walking in darkness Have seen a great light
Thou hast multiplied the nation
Because the yoke of its burden
For every battle of a warrior `is' with rushing
For a Child hath been born to us
To the increase of the princely power
A word hath the Lord sent into Jacob
And the people have known -- all of it
`Bricks have fallen
And Jehovah setteth the adversaries of Rezin on high above him
Aram from before
And the people hath not turned back unto Him who is smiting it
And Jehovah cutteth off from Israel head and tail
Elder
And the eulogists of this people are causing to err
Therefore
For burned as a fire hath wickedness
In the wrath of Jehovah of Hosts Hath the land been consumed
And cutteth down on the right
Manasseh -- Ephraim
