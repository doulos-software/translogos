Thus said Jehovah: `Where `is' this -- the bill of your mother's divorce
Wherefore have I come
I clothe the heavens `with' blackness
The Lord Jehovah hath given to me The tongue of taught ones
The Lord Jehovah opened for me the ear
My back I have given to those smiting
And the Lord Jehovah giveth help to me
Near `is' He who is justifying me
Lo
Who `is' among you
Lo
