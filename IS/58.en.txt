Call with the throat
Seeing -- Me day by day they seek
`Why have we fasted
Lo
Like this is the fast that I choose? The day of a man's afflicting his soul? To bow as a reed his head
Is not this the fast that I chose -- To loose the bands of wickedness
Is it not to deal to the hungry thy bread
Then broken up as the dawn is thy light
Then thou callest
And dost bring out to the hungry thy soul
And Jehovah doth lead thee continually
And they have built out of thee the wastes of old
If thou dost turn from the sabbath thy foot
Then dost thou delight thyself on Jehovah
