They joy from the wilderness and dry place
Flourishing it doth flourish
Strengthen ye the feeble hands
Say to the hastened of heart
Then opened are eyes of the blind
Then leap as a hart doth the lame
And the mirage hath become a pond
And a highway hath been there
No lion is there
And the ransomed of Jehovah return
