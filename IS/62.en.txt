For Zion's sake I am not silent
And nations have seen thy righteousness
And thou hast been a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah
It is not said of thee any more
For a young man doth marry a virgin
`On thy walls
And give not silence to Him
Sworn hath Jehovah by His right hand
For
Pass ye on
Lo
And they have cried to them
