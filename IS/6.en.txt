In the year of the death of king Uzziah -- I see the Lord
Seraphs are standing above it: six wings hath each one; with two `each' covereth its face
And this one hath called unto that
And the posts of the thresholds are moved by the voice of him who is calling
And I say
And flee unto me doth one of the seraphs
and he striketh against my mouth
And I hear the voice of the Lord
And He saith
Declare fat the heart of this people
And I say
And Jehovah hath put man far off
And yet in it a tenth
