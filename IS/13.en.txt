The burden of Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz hath seen:"
`On a high mountain lift ye up an ensign
I have given charge to My sanctified ones
A voice of a multitude in the mountains
They are coming in from a land afar off
Howl ye
Therefore
And they have been troubled
Lo
For the stars of the heavens
And I have appointed on the world evil
I make man more rare than fine gold
Therefore the heavens I cause to tremble
And it hath been
Every one who is found is thrust through
And their sucklings are dashed to pieces before their eyes
Lo
And bows dash young men to pieces
And Babylon
She doth not sit for ever
And Ziim have lain down there
And Aiim have responded in his forsaken habitations
