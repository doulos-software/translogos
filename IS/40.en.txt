Comfort ye
Speak to the heart of Jerusalem
A voice is crying -- in a wilderness -- Prepare ye the way of Jehovah
Every valley is raised up
And revealed hath been the honour of Jehovah
A voice is saying
Withered hath grass
Withered hath grass
On a high mountain get thee up
Lo
As a shepherd His flock He feedeth
Who hath measured in the hollow of his hand the waters? And the heavens by a span hath meted out
Who hath meted out the Spirit of Jehovah
With whom consulted He
Lo
And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn
All the nations `are' as nothing before Him
And unto whom do ye liken God
The graven image poured out hath a artizan
He who is poor `by' heave-offerings
Do ye not know -- do ye not hear? Hath it not been declared from the first to you? Have ye not understood `From' the foundations of the earth?"
He who is sitting on the circle of the earth
He who is making princes become nothing
Yea
And unto whom do ye liken Me
Lift up on high your eyes
Why sayest thou
Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard? The God of the age -- Jehovah
He is giving power to the weary
Even youths are wearied and fatigued
But those expecting Jehovah pass `to' power
