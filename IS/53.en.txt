Who hath given credence to that which we heard? And the arm of Jehovah
Yea
He is despised
Surely our sicknesses he hath borne
And he is pierced for our transgressions
All of us like sheep have wandered
It hath been exacted
By restraint and by judgment he hath been taken
And it appointeth with the wicked his grave
And Jehovah hath delighted to bruise him
Of the labour of his soul he seeth -- he is satisfied
Therefore I give a portion to him among the many
