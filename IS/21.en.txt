The burden of the wilderness of the sea. `Like hurricanes in the south for passing through
A hard vision hath been declared to me
Therefore filled have been my loins `with' great pain
Wandered hath my heart
Arrange the table
For thus said the Lord unto me: `Go
And he hath seen a chariot -- a couple of horsemen
And he crieth -- a lion
And lo
O my threshing
The burden of Dumah. Unto me is `one' calling from Seir `Watchman
The watchman hath said
The burden on Arabia. In a forest in Arabia ye lodge
To meet the thirsty brought water have Inhabitants of the land of Tema
For from the face of destructions they fled
For thus said the Lord unto me: `Within a year
And the remnant of the number of bow-men
