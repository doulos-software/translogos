Let me sing
And he fenceth it
And now
What -- to do still to my vineyard
And now
And I make it a waste
Because the vineyard of Jehovah of Hosts `Is' the house of Israel
Wo `to' those joining house to house
By the weapons of Jehovah of Hosts Do not many houses a desolation become? Great and good without inhabitant!"
For ten acres of vineyard do yield one bath
Wo `to' those rising early in the morning
And harp
Therefore my people removed without knowledge
Therefore hath Sheol enlarged herself
And bowed down is the low
And Jehovah of Hosts is high in judgment
And fed have lambs according to their leading
Wo `to' those drawing out iniquity with cords of vanity
Who are saying
Wo `to' those saying to evil `good
Wo `to' the wise in their own eyes
Wo `to' the mighty to drink wine
Declaring righteous the wicked for a bribe
Therefore
Therefore hath the anger of Jehovah burned among His people
And He lifted up an ensign to nations afar off
There is none weary
Whose arrows `are' sharp
Its roaring `is' like a lioness
And it howleth against it in that day as the howling of a sea
