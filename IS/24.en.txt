Lo
And it hath been -- as a people so a priest
Utterly emptied is the land
Mourned
And the land hath been defiled under its inhabitants
Therefore a curse hath consumed the land
Mourned hath the new wine
Ceased hath the joy of tabrets
With a song they drink not wine
It was broken down -- a city of emptiness
A cry over the wine `is' in out-places
Left in the city `is' desolation
When thus it is in the heart of the land
They -- they lift up their voice
Therefore in prosperity honour ye Jehovah
From the skirt of the earth we heard songs
Fear
And it hath come to pass
Utterly broken down hath been the land
Stagger greatly doth the land as a drunkard
And it hath come to pass
And they have been gathered -- A gathering of bound ones in a pit
And confounded hath been the moon
