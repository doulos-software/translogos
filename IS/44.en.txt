And now
Thus said Jehovah
For I pour waters on a thirsty one
And they have sprung up as among grass
This `one' saith
Thus said Jehovah
And who as I
Fear not
Framers of a graven image `are' all of them emptiness
Who hath formed a god
Lo
He hath wrought iron `with' an axe
He hath wrought `with' wood
Cutting down to himself cedars
And it hath been for man to burn
Half of it he hath burnt in the fire
And its remnant for a god he hath made -- For his graven image
They have not known
And none doth turn `it' back unto his heart
Feeding on ashes
Remember these
I have blotted out
Sing
Thus said Jehovah
Making void the tokens of devisers
Confirming the word of His servant
Who is saying to the deep
Who is saying of Cyrus
