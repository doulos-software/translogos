And now
When thou passest into waters
For I -- Jehovah thy God
Since thou wast precious in Mine eyes
Be not afraid
I am saying to the north
Every one who is called by My name
He brought out a blind people who have eyes
All the nations have been gathered together
Ye `are' My witnesses
I -- I `am' Jehovah
I -- I declared
Even from the day I `am' He
Thus said Jehovah
I `am' Jehovah
Thus said Jehovah
Who is bringing forth chariot and horse
Remember not former things
Lo
Honour me doth the beast of the field
This people I have formed for Myself
And Me thou hast not called
Thou hast not brought in to Me
Thou hast not bought for Me with money sweet cane
I -- I `am' He who is blotting out Thy transgressions for Mine own sake
Cause me to remember -- we are judged together
Thy first father sinned
And I pollute princes of the sanctuary
