The burden of Egypt. Lo
And I armed Egyptians against Egyptians
And emptied out hath been in its midst the spirit of Egypt. And its counsel I swallow up
And I have delivered the Egyptians Into the hand of a hard lord
And failed have waters from the sea
And they have turned away the flowings
Exposed things by the brook
And lamented have the fishers
And ashamed have been makers of fine flax
And its foundations have been smitten
Only
Where `are' they now
Foolish have been princes of Zoan
Jehovah hath mingled in her midst A spirit of perverseness
And there is no work to Egypt
In that day is Egypt like women
And the land of Judah hath been to Egypt for a cause of staggering
In that day there are five cities in the land of Egypt
In that day there is an altar to Jehovah In the midst of the land of Egypt
And it hath been for a sign and for a testimony
And known hath been Jehovah to Egypt
And Jehovah hath smitten Egypt
In that day is a highway out of Egypt to Asshur
In that day is Israel third
In that Jehovah of Hosts did bless it
