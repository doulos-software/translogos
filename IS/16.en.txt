Send ye a lamb `to' the ruler of the land
And it hath come to pass
Bring ye in counsel
Sojourn in thee do My outcasts
And established in kindness is the throne
We have heard of the pride of Moab -- very proud
Therefore howl doth Moab for Moab
Because fields of Heshbon languish
Therefore I weep with the weeping of Jazer
And removed have been gladness and joy from the fruitful field
Therefore my bowels for Moab as a harp do sound
And it hath come to pass
This `is' the word that Jehovah hath spoken unto Moab from that time
And now hath Jehovah spoken
