Wo `to' Ariel
And I have sent distress to Ariel
And I encamped
And thou hast been low
And as small dust hath been The multitude of those scattering thee
By Jehovah of Hosts thou art inspected
And as a dream
And it hath been
Tarry and wonder
For poured out on you hath Jehovah a spirit of deep sleep
And the vision of the whole is to you
And the book is given to him who hath not known books
And the Lord saith: Because drawn near hath this people
Therefore
Wo `to' those going deep from Jehovah to hide counsel
Your perversion! as clay is the potter esteemed? That the work saith of its maker
Is it not yet a very little
And heard in that day have the deaf the words of a book
And the humble have added joy in Jehovah
For ceased hath the terrible one
Causing men to sin in word
Therefore
For in his seeing his children
And the erring in spirit have known understanding
