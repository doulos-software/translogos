Awake
Shake thyself from dust
For thus said Jehovah: `For nought ye have been sold
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: `To Egypt My people went down at first to sojourn there
And now
Therefore doth My people know My name
How comely on the mountains
The voice of thy watchmen! They have lifted up the voice
Break forth
Jehovah hath made bare His holy arm Before the eyes of all the nations
Turn aside
For not in haste do ye go out
Lo
As astonished at thee have been many
So doth he sprinkle many nations. Concerning him kings shut their mouth
