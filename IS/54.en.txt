Sing
Enlarge the place of thy tent
For right and left thou breakest forth
And desolate cities they cause to be inhabited. Fear not
For thy Maker `is' thy husband
For
In a small moment I have forsaken thee
In overflowing wrath I hid my face `for' a moment from thee
For
For the mountains depart
O afflicted
And have made of agate thy pinnacles
And all thy sons are taught of Jehovah
In righteousness thou establishest thyself
Lo
Lo
No weapon formed against thee prospereth
