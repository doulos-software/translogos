Wo `to' the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim. And the fading flower of the beauty of his glory
Lo
By feet trodden down is the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim
And the fading flower of the beauty of his glory That `is' on the head of the fat valley
In that day is Jehovah of Hosts For a crown of beauty
And for a spirit of judgment To him who is sitting in the judgment
And even these through wine have erred
For all tables have been full of vomit
By whom doth He teach knowledge? And by whom doth He cause to understand the report? The weaned from milk
For rule `is' on rule
For by scorned lip
Unto whom He hath said
And to whom a word of Jehovah hath been
Therefore
Because ye have said: `We have made a covenant with death
Therefore
And I have put judgment for a line
And disannulled hath been your covenant with death
From the fulness of its passing over it taketh you
For shorter hath been the bed Than to stretch one's self out in
For as `at' mount Perazim rise doth Jehovah
And now
Give ear
The whole day plougheth the ploughman to sow? He openeth and harroweth his ground!"
Hath he not
And instruct him for judgment doth his God
For not with a sharp-pointed thing threshed are fitches
Bread-`corn' is beaten small
Even this from Jehovah of Hosts hath gone out
