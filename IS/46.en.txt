Bowed down hath Bel
They have stooped
Hearken unto Me
Even to old age I `am' He
To whom do ye liken Me
-- They are pouring out gold from a bag
They lift him up on the shoulder
Remember this
Remember former things of old
Declaring from the beginning the latter end
Calling from the east a ravenous bird
Hearken unto Me
I have brought near My righteousness
