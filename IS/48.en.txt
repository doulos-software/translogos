Hear ye this
For from the Holy City they have been called
The former things from that time I declared
From my knowing that thou art obstinate
And I declare to thee from that time
Thou hast heard
Now they have been produced and not from that time
Yea
For My name's sake I defer Mine anger
Lo
For My sake
Hearken to me
Also
Be gathered all of you
I -- I have spoken
Come ye near unto me
Thus said Jehovah
O that thou hadst attended to My commands
And as sand is thy seed
Go out from Babylon
And they have not thirsted in waste places
There is no peace
