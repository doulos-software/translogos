Because Jehovah loveth Jacob
And peoples have taken them
And it hath come to pass
That thou hast taken up this simile Concerning the king of Babylon
Ceased hath the golden one. Broken hath Jehovah the staff of the wicked
He who is smiting peoples in wrath
At rest -- quiet hath been all the earth
Even firs have rejoiced over thee
Sheol beneath hath been troubled at thee
All of them answer and say unto thee
Brought down to Sheol hath been thine excellency
How hast thou fallen from the heavens
And thou saidst in thy heart: the heavens I go up
I go up above the heights of a thick cloud
Only -- unto Sheol thou art brought down
Thy beholders look to thee
He hath made the world as a wilderness
All kings of nations -- all of them
And -- thou hast been cast out of thy grave
Thou art not united with them in burial
Prepare ye for his sons slaughter; Because of the iniquity of their fathers
And I have risen up against them
And have made it for a possession of a bittern
Sworn hath Jehovah of Hosts
To break Asshur in My land
This `is' the counsel that is counselled for all the earth
For Jehovah of Hosts hath purposed
In the year of the death of king Ahaz was this burden:"
Rejoice not thou
And delighted have the first-born of the poor
Howl
And what doth one answer the messengers of a nation? `That Jehovah hath founded Zion
