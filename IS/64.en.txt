Didst Thou not rend the heavens? Thou didst come down
(As fire kindleth stubble -- Fire causeth water to boil
In Thy doing fearful things -- we expect not
Even from antiquity `men' have not heard
Thou hast met with the rejoicer And the doer of righteousness
And we are as unclean -- all of us
And there is none calling in Thy name
And now
Be not wroth
Thy holy cities have been a wilderness
Our holy and our beautiful house
For these dost Thou refrain Thyself
