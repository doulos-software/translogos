O Jehovah
For Thou didst make of a city a heap
Therefore honour Thee do a strong people
For Thou hast been a stronghold for the poor
As heat in a dry place
And made hath Jehovah of Hosts
And swallowed up hath He in this mountain The face of the wrapping that is wrapped over all the peoples
He hath swallowed up death in victory
And `one' hath said in that day
For rest doth the hand of Jehovah on this mountain
And he spread out his hands in its midst
And the fortress of the high place of thy walls He hath bowed down -- He hath made low
