My brethren
for if there may come into your synagogue a man with gold ring
and ye may look upon him bearing the gay raiment
ye did not judge fully in yourselves
Hearken
and ye did dishonour the poor one; do not the rich oppress you and themselves draw you to judgment-seats;"
do they not themselves speak evil of the good name that was called upon you?"
If
and if ye accept persons
for whoever the whole law shall keep
for He who is saying
so speak ye and so do
for the judgment without kindness `is' to him not having done kindness
What `is' the profit
and if a brother or sister may be naked
and any one of you may say to them
so also the faith
But say may some one
thou -- thou dost believe that God is one; thou dost well
And dost thou wish to know
Abraham our father -- was not he declared righteous out of works
dost thou see that the faith was working with his works
and fulfilled was the Writing that is saying
Ye see
and in like manner also Rahab the harlot -- was she not out of works declared righteous
for as the body apart from the spirit is dead
