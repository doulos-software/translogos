Whence `are' wars and fightings among you? not thence -- out of your passions
ye desire
ye ask
Adulterers and adulteresses! have ye not known that friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever
Do ye think that emptily the Writing saith
and greater grace he doth give
be subject
draw nigh to God
be exceeding afflicted
be made low before the Lord
Speak not one against another
one is the lawgiver
Go
who do not know the thing of the morrow; for what is your life? for it is a vapour that is appearing for a little
instead of your saying
and now ye glory in your pride; all such glorying is evil;"
to him
