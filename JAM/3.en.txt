Many teachers become not
for we all make many stumbles; if any one in word doth not stumble
lo
lo
so also the tongue is a little member
and the tongue `is' a fire
For every nature
and the tongue no one of men is able to subdue
with it we do bless the God and Father
out of the same mouth doth come forth blessing and cursing; it doth not need
doth the fountain out of the same opening pour forth the sweet and the bitter?"
is a fig-tree able
Who `is' wise and intelligent among you? let him shew out of the good behaviour his works in meekness of wisdom
and if bitter zeal ye have
this wisdom is not descending from above
for where zeal and rivalry `are'
and the wisdom from above
and the fruit of the righteousness in peace is sown to those making peace."
