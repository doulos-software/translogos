James
All joy count `it'
knowing that the proof of your faith doth work endurance
and let the endurance have a perfect work
and if any of you do lack wisdom
and let him ask in faith
for let not that man suppose that he shall receive anything from the Lord --"
a two-souled man `is' unstable in all his ways."
And let the brother who is low rejoice in his exaltation
and the rich in his becoming low
for the sun did rise with the burning heat
Happy the man who doth endure temptation
Let no one say
and each one is tempted
afterward the desire having conceived
Be not led astray
every good giving
having counselled
So then
for the wrath of a man the righteousness of God doth not work;"
wherefore having put aside all filthiness and superabundance of evil
and become ye doers of the word
because
for he did view himself
and he who did look into the perfect law -- that of liberty
If any one doth think to be religious among you
religion pure and undefiled with the God and Father is this
