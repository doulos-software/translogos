Go
your riches have rotted
your gold and silver have rotted
lo
ye did live in luxury upon the earth
ye did condemn -- ye did murder the righteous one
Be patient
be patient
murmur not against one another
An example take ye of the suffering of evil
lo
And before all things
Doth any one suffer evil among you? let him pray; is any of good cheer? let him sing psalms;"
is any infirm among you? let him call for the elders of the assembly
and the prayer of the faith shall save the distressed one
Be confessing to one another the trespasses
Elijah was a man like affected as we
and again he did pray
Brethren
let him know that he who did turn back a sinner from the straying of his way shall save a soul from death
