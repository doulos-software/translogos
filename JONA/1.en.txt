And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jonah son of Amittai
`Rise
And Jonah riseth to flee to Tarshish from the face of Jehovah
And Jehovah hath cast a great wind on the sea
and the mariners are afraid
And the chief of the company draweth near to him
And they say each unto his neighbour
And they say unto him
And he saith unto them
And the men fear a great fear
And they say unto him
And he saith unto them
And the men row to turn back unto the dry land
And they cry unto Jehovah
And they lift up Jonah
and the men fear Jehovah -- a great fear
And Jehovah appointeth a great fish to swallow up Jonah
