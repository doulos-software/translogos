And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jonah a second time
`Rise
and Jonah riseth
And Jonah beginneth to go in to the city a journey of one day
And the men of Nineveh believe in God
seeing the word doth come unto the king of Nineveh
and he crieth and saith in Nineveh by a decree of the king and his great ones
and cover themselves `with' sackcloth let man and beast
Who knoweth? He doth turn back
And God seeth their works
