And it is grievous unto Jonah -- a great evil -- and he is displeased at it;"
and he prayeth unto Jehovah
And now
And Jehovah saith
And Jonah goeth forth from the city
And Jehovah God appointeth a gourd
And God appointeth a worm at the going up of the dawn on the morrow
And it cometh to pass
And God saith unto Jonah: `Is doing good displeasing to thee
And Jehovah saith
and I -- have not I pity on Nineveh
