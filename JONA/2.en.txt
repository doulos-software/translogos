And Jonah prayeth unto Jehovah his God from the bowels of the fish."
And he saith: I called
When Thou dost cast me `into' the deep
And I -- I said: I have been cast out from before Thine eyes
Compassed me have waters unto the soul
To the cuttings of mountains I have come down
In the feebleness within me of my soul Jehovah I have remembered
Those observing lying vanities their own mercy forsake."
And I -- with a voice of thanksgiving -- I sacrifice to Thee
And Jehovah saith to the fish
