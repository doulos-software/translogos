And it cometh to pass
and they take captive the women who `are' in it; from small unto great they have not put any one to death
And David cometh in -- and his men -- unto the city
And David lifteth up -- and the people who `are' with him -- their voice and weep
And the two wives of David have been taken captive
and David hath great distress
And David saith unto Abiathar the priest
and David asketh at Jehovah
And David goeth on
and David pursueth
and they find a man
and give to him a piece of a bunch of dried figs
And David saith to him
we pushed `to' the south of the Cherethite
And David saith unto him
And he bringeth him down
And David smiteth them from the twilight even unto the evening of the morrow
And David delivereth all that the Amalekites have taken; also his two wives hath David delivered."
And there hath not lacked to them `anything'
and David taketh the whole of the flock
And David cometh in unto the two hundred men who were too faint to go after David
And every bad and worthless man
And David saith
and who doth hearken to you in this thing? for as the portion of him who was brought down into battle
And it cometh to pass from that day and forward
And David cometh in unto Ziklag
to those in Beth-El
and to those in Aroer
and to those in Rachal
and to those in Hormah
and to those in Hebron
