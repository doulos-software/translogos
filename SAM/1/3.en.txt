And the youth Samuel is serving Jehovah before Eli
And it cometh to pass
And the lamp of God is not yet extinguished
and Jehovah calleth unto Samuel
And he runneth unto Eli
And Jehovah addeth to call again Samuel
And Samuel hath not yet known Jehovah
And Jehovah addeth to call Samuel the third time
And Eli saith to Samuel
And Jehovah cometh
And Jehovah saith unto Samuel
In that day I establish unto Eli all that I have spoken unto his house
and I have declared to him that I am judging his house -- to the age
and therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli: the iniquity of the house of Eli is not atoned for
And Samuel lieth till the morning
And Eli calleth Samuel
And he saith
And Samuel declareth to him the whole of the words
And Samuel groweth up
and all Israel know
And Jehovah addeth to appear in Shiloh
