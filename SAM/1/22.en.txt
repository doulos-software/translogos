And David goeth thence
and gather themselves unto him do every man in distress
And David goeth thence to Mizpeh of Moab
and he leadeth them before the king of Moab
And Gad the prophet saith unto David
And Saul heareth that David hath become known
And Saul saith to his servants who are standing by him
for ye have conspired all of you against me
And answer doth Doeg the Edomite
and he asketh for him at Jehovah
And the king sendeth to call Ahimelech son of Ahitub
and Saul saith
And Saul saith unto him
And Ahimelech answereth the king and saith
To-day have I begun to ask for him at God? far be it from me! let not the king lay anything against his servant
And the king saith
And the king saith to runners
And the king saith to Doeg
and Nob
And there escapeth one son of Ahimelech
and Abiathar declareth to David that Saul hath slain the priests of Jehovah."
And David saith to Abiathar
dwell with me; fear not; for he who seeketh my life seeketh thy life; for a charge `art' thou with me.'"
