And David saith unto his heart
And David riseth
and David dwelleth with Achish in Gath
And it is declared to Saul that David hath fled to Gath
And David saith unto Achish
And Achish giveth to him in that day Ziklag
And the number of the days which David hath dwelt in the field of the Philistines `is' days and four months;"
and David goeth up and his men
and David hath smitten the land
And Achish saith
Neither man nor woman doth David keep alive
And Achish believeth in David
