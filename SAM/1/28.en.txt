And it cometh to pass in those days
And David saith unto Achish
And Samuel hath died
And the Philistines are gathered
and Saul seeth the camp of the Philistines
and Saul asketh at Jehovah
And Saul saith to his servants
And Saul disguiseth himself and putteth on other garments
And the woman saith unto him
And Saul sweareth to her by Jehovah
And the woman saith
And the woman seeth Samuel
And the king saith to her
And he saith to her
And Samuel saith unto Saul
And Samuel saith
And Jehovah doth for Himself as He hath spoken by my hand
Because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah
yea
And Saul hasteth and falleth -- the fulness of his stature -- to the earth
And the woman cometh in unto Saul
and now
And he refuseth
And the woman hath a calf of the stall in the house
and bringeth nigh before Saul
