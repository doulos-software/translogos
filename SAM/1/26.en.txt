And the Ziphites come in unto Saul
And Saul riseth
And Saul encampeth in the height of Hachilah
and David sendeth spies
and David riseth
And David answereth and saith unto Ahimelech the Hittite
And David cometh -- and Abishai -- unto the people by night
And Abishai saith unto David
And David saith unto Abishai
And David saith
far be it from me
And David taketh the spear
And David passeth over to the other side
and David calleth unto the people
And David saith unto Abner
Not good is this thing which thou hast done; Jehovah liveth
And Saul discerneth the voice of David
and he saith
And
`And now
And Saul saith
And David answereth and saith
and Jehovah doth turn back to each his righteousness and his faithfulness
and lo
And Saul saith unto David
