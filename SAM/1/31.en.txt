And the Philistines are fighting against Israel
and the Philistines follow Saul and his sons
And the battle is hard against Saul
and Saul saith to the bearer of his weapons
And the bearer of his weapons seeth that Saul `is' dead
and Saul dieth
And they see -- the men of Israel
And it cometh to pass on the morrow
and they cut off his head
and they place his weapons `in' the house of Ashtaroth
And they hear regarding it -- the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead -- that which the Philistines have done to Saul
and all the men of valour arise
and they take their bones
