And Samuel dieth
And `there is' a man in Maon
And the name of the man `is' Nabal
And David heareth in the wilderness that Nabal is shearing his flock
and David sendeth ten young men
and said thus: To life! and thou
and
`Ask thy young men
And the young men of David come in
And Nabal answereth the servants of David and saith
and I have taken my bread
And the young men of David turn on their way
And David saith to his men
And to Abigail wife of Nabal hath one young man of the youths declared
and the men `are' very good to us
a wall they have been unto us both by night and by day
`And
And Abigail hasteth
And she saith to her young men
and it hath come to pass
And David said
thus doth God do to the enemies of David
And Abigail seeth David
and falleth at his feet and saith
`Let not
and now
`And
`Bear
And man riseth to pursue thee and to seek thy soul
`And it hath been
that this is not to thee for a stumbling-block
And David saith to Abigail
and blessed `is' thy discretion
And yet
And David receiveth from her hand that which she hath brought to him
And Abigail cometh in unto Nabal
And it cometh to pass in the morning
And it cometh to pass
and David heareth that Nabal `is' dead
And the servants of David come in unto Abigail at Carmel
And she riseth and boweth herself -- face to the earth -- and saith
And Abigail hasteth and riseth
And Ahinoam hath David taken from Jezreel
and Saul gave Michal his daughter
