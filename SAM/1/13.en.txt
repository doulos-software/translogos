A son of a year `is' Saul in his reigning
and Saul chooseth for himself three thousand `men' out of Israel; and two thousand are with Saul in Michmash
And Jonathan smiteth the garrison of the Philistines which `is' in Geba
And all Israel have heard
And the Philistines have been gathered to fight with Israel; thirty thousand chariots
And the men of Israel have seen that they are distressed
And Hebrews have passed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; and Saul `is' yet in Gilgal
And he waiteth seven days
And Saul saith
And it cometh to pass at his completing to cause the burnt-offering to ascend
and Samuel saith
and I say
And Samuel saith unto Saul
and
And Samuel riseth
and Saul
And the destroyer goeth out from the camp of the Philistines -- three detachments; the one detachment turneth unto the way of Ophrah
and the one detachment turneth the way of Beth-Horon
And an artificer is not found in all the land of Israel
and all Israel go down to the Philistines
and there hath been the file for mattocks
And it hath been
And the station of the Philistines goeth out unto the passage of Michmash."
