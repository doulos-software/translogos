And they declare to David
And David asketh at Jehovah
And David's men say unto him
And David addeth again to ask at Jehovah
And David goeth
And it cometh to pass
And it is declared to Saul that David hath come in to Keilah
And Saul summoneth the whole of the people to battle
And David knoweth that against him Saul is devising the evil
And David saith
Do the possessors of Keilah shut me up into his hand? doth Saul come down as Thy servant hath heard? Jehovah
And David saith
And David riseth -- and his men -- about six hundred men
And David abideth in the wilderness
And David seeth that Saul hath come out to seek his life
And Jonathan son of Saul riseth
and saith unto him
And they make a covenant both of them before Jehovah; and David abideth in the forest
And the Ziphites go up unto Saul to Gibeah
And
And Saul saith
go
And see and know of all the hiding-places where he hideth himself
And they rise and go to Ziph before Saul
And Saul and his men go to seek
And Saul goeth on this side of the mountain
And a messenger hath come in unto Saul
And Saul turneth back from pursuing after David
And David goeth up thence
