And it cometh to pass
And the name of his first-born son is Joel
and his sons have not walked in his ways
And all the elders of Israel gather themselves together
and say unto him
And the thing is evil in the eyes of Samuel
And Jehovah saith unto Samuel
According to all the works that they have done from the day of My bringing them up out of Egypt
And now
And Samuel speaketh all the words of Jehovah unto the people who are asking from him a king
and saith
also to appoint for himself heads of thousands
`And your daughters he doth take for perfumers
and your fields
And your seed and your vineyards he doth tithe
And your men-servants
your flock he doth tithe
And ye have cried out in that day because of the king whom ye have chosen for yourselves
And the people refuse to hearken to the voice of Samuel
and we have been
And Samuel heareth all the words of the people
and Jehovah saith unto Samuel
