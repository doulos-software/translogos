And Samuel saith unto all Israel
and now
`Lo
And they say
And he saith unto them
And Samuel saith unto the people
and
`When Jacob hath come in to Egypt
and they forget Jehovah their God
and they cry unto Jehovah
`And Jehovah sendeth Jerubbaal
`And ye see that Nahash king of the Bene-Ammon hath come against you
And
`If ye fear Jehovah
`And if ye do not hearken to the voice of Jehovah -- then ye have provoked the mouth of Jehovah
`Also now
is it not wheat-harvest to-day? I call unto Jehovah
And Samuel calleth unto Jehovah
and all the people say unto Samuel
And Samuel saith unto the people
and ye do not turn aside after the vain things which do not profit nor deliver
for Jehovah doth not leave His people
`I
only
and if ye really do evil
