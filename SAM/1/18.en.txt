And it cometh to pass
And Saul taketh him on that day
And Jonathan maketh -- also David -- a covenant
and Jonathan strippeth himself of the upper robe which `is' upon him
And David goeth out whithersoever Saul doth send him; he acted wisely
And it cometh to pass
and the women answer -- those playing
And it is displeasing to Saul exceedingly
and Saul is eyeing David from that day and thenceforth."
And it cometh to pass
and Saul casteth the javelin
And Saul is afraid of the presence of David
and Saul turneth him aside from him
And David is in all his ways acting wisely
and Saul seeth that he is acting very wisely
and all Israel and Judah love David when he is going out and coming in before them."
And Saul saith unto David
And David saith unto Saul
And it cometh to pass
And Michal daughter of Saul loveth David
and Saul saith
And Saul commandeth his servants
And the servants of Saul speak in the ears of David these words
And the servants of Saul declare to him
And Saul saith
And his servants declare to David these words
and David riseth and goeth
And Saul seeth and knoweth that Jehovah `is' with David
and Saul addeth to be afraid of the presence of David yet; and Saul is an enemy with David all the days."
And the princes of the Philistines come out
