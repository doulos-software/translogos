And the Philistines have taken the ark of God
and the Philistines take the ark of God and bring it into the house of Dagon
And the Ashdodites rise early on the morrow
And they rise early in the morning on the morrow
therefore the priests of Dagon
And the hand of Jehovah is heavy on the Ashdodites
And the men of Ashdod see that `it is' so
And they send and gather all the princes of the Philistines unto them
and it cometh to pass after they have brought it round
And they send the ark of God to Ekron
And they send and gather all the princes of the Philistines
and the men who have not died have been smitten with emerods
