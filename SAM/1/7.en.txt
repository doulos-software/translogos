And the men of Kirjath-Jearim come and bring up the ark of Jehovah
And it cometh to pass
And Samuel speaketh unto all the house of Israel
And the sons of Israel turn aside the Baalim and Ashtaroth
and Samuel saith
And they are gathered to Mizpeh
And the Philistines hear that the sons of Israel have gathered themselves to Mizpeh; and the princes of the Philistines go up against Israel
And the sons of Israel say unto Samuel
And Samuel taketh a fat lamb
and Samuel is causing the burnt-offering to go up -- and the Philistines have drawn nigh to battle against Israel -- and Jehovah doth thunder with a great noise
And the men of Israel go out from Mizpeh
And Samuel taketh a stone
And the Philistines are humbled
And the cities which the Philistines have taken from Israel are restored to Israel -- from Ekron even unto Gath -- and their border hath Israel delivered out of the hand of the Philistines; and there is peace between Israel and the Amorite."
And Samuel judgeth Israel all the days of his life
and he hath gone from year to year
and his returning `is' to Ramath
