And Nahash the Ammonite cometh up
And Nahash the Ammonite saith unto them
And the elders of Jabesh say to him
And the messengers come to Gibeah of Saul
and lo
And the Spirit of God doth prosper over Saul
and he taketh a couple of oxen
And he inspecteth them in Bezek
And they say to the messengers who are coming
and the men of Jabesh say `to the Ammonites'
And it cometh to pass
And the people say unto Samuel
And Saul saith
And Samuel saith unto the people
and all the people go to Gilgal
