And there is a man of Benjamin
and he hath a son
And the asses of Kish
And he passeth over through the hill-country of Ephraim
They have come in unto the land of Zuph
And he saith to him
And Saul saith to his young man
And the young man addeth to answer Saul
Formerly in Israel
And Saul saith to his young man
They are going up in the ascent of the city
And they answer them and say
At your going in to the city so ye do find him
And they go up in to the city; they are coming in to the midst of the city
and Jehovah had uncovered the ear of Samuel one day before the coming of Saul
`At this time tomorrow
When Samuel hath seen Saul
And Saul draweth nigh to Samuel in the midst of the gate
And Samuel answereth Saul and saith
As to the asses which are lost to thee this day three days
And Saul answereth and saith
And Samuel taketh Saul
And Samuel saith to the cook
(and the cook lifteth up the leg
And they come down from the high place to the city
And they rise early
They are going down in the extremity of the city
