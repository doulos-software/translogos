And the day cometh that Jonathan son of Saul saith unto the young man bearing his weapons
And Saul is abiding at the extremity of Gibeah
and Ahiah
And between the passages where Jonathan sought to pass over unto the station of the Philistines `is' the edge of a rock on the one side
The one edge `is' fixed on the north over-against Michmash
And Jonathan saith unto the young man bearing his weapons
And the bearer of his weapons saith to him
And Jonathan saith
if thus they say unto us
and if thus they say
And revealed are both of them unto the station of the Philistines
And the men of the station answer Jonathan
And Jonathan goeth up on his hands
And the first smiting which Jonathan and the bearer of his weapons have smitten is of about twenty men
and there is a trembling in the camp
And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin see
And Saul saith to the people who `are' with him
And Saul saith to Ahiah
And it cometh to pass
And Saul is called
And the Hebrews `who' have been for the Philistines as heretofore
and all the men of Israel
And Jehovah saveth Israel on that day
And the men of Israel have been distressed on that day
And all `they of' the land have come into a forest
and the people come in unto the forest
And Jonathan hath not heard of his father's adjuring the people
And a man of the people answereth and saith
And Jonathan saith
How much more if the people had well eaten to-day of the spoil of its enemies which it hath found
And they smite on that day among the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon
and the people make unto the spoil
And they declare to Saul
And Saul saith
And Saul buildeth an alter to Jehovah; with it he hath begun to build altars to Jehovah."
And Saul saith
And Saul asketh of God
And Saul saith
for
And he saith unto all Israel
And Saul saith unto Jehovah
And Saul saith
And Saul saith unto Jonathan
And Saul saith
And the people say unto Saul
And Saul goeth up from after the Philistines
and Saul captured the kingdom over Israel
And he maketh a force
And the sons of Saul are Jonathan
and the name of the wife of Saul `is' Ahinoam
and Kish `is' father of Saul
And the war is severe against the Philistines all the days of Saul; when Saul hath seen any mighty man
