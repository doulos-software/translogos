And there is a certain man of Ramathaim-Zophim
and he hath two wives
And that man hath gone up out of his city from time to time
And the day cometh
and to Hannah he giveth a certain portion -- double
and her adversity hath also provoked her greatly
And so he doth year by year
And Elkanah her husband saith to her
And Hannah riseth after eating in Shiloh
And she is bitter in soul
and voweth a vow
And it hath been
and Hannah
And Eli saith unto her
And Hannah answereth and saith
put not thy handmaid before a daughter of worthlessness
And Eli answereth and saith
And she saith
And they rise early in the morning
and it cometh to pass
And the man Elkanah goeth up
And Hannah hath not gone up
And Elkanah her husband saith to her
and she causeth him to go up with her when she hath weaned him
And they slaughter the bullock
and she saith
for this youth I prayed
and also I have caused him to be asked for Jehovah
