And the Philistines gather all their camps to Aphek
and the princes of the Philistines are passing on by hundreds
And the heads of the Philistines say
And the heads of the Philistines are wroth against him
Is not this David
And Achish calleth unto David
and now
And David saith unto Achish
And Achish answereth and saith unto David
and now
And David riseth early
