And it cometh to pass when Saul hath turned back from after the Philistines
And Saul taketh three thousand chosen men out of all Israel
and he cometh in unto folds of the flock
And the men of David say unto him
And it cometh to pass afterwards that the heart of David smiteth him
and he saith to his men
And David subdueth his men by words
and David riseth afterwards
And David saith to Saul
Lo
`And
`Jehovah doth judge between me and thee
as saith the simile of the ancients
`After whom hath the king of Israel come out? after whom art thou pursuing? -- after a dead dog! after one flea!"
And Jehovah hath been for judge
And it cometh to pass
And he saith unto David
and thou hast declared to-day how that thou hast done good with me
and that a man doth find his enemy
`And
and
And David sweareth to Saul
