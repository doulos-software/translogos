And Samuel saith unto Saul
`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts
Now
And Saul summoneth the people
And Saul cometh in unto a city of Amalek
and Saul saith unto the Kenite
And Saul smiteth Amalek from Havilah -- thy going in to Shur
and he catcheth Agag king of Amalek alive
and Saul hath pity -- also the people -- on Agag
And the word of Jehovah is unto Samuel
`I have repented that I caused Saul to reign for king
And Samuel riseth early to meet Saul in the morning
And Samuel cometh in unto Saul
And Samuel saith
And Saul saith
And Samuel saith unto Saul
And Samuel saith
and Jehovah sendeth thee in the way
and why hast thou not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah -- and dost fly unto the spoil
And Saul saith unto Samuel
and the people taketh of the spoil of the flock and herd
And Samuel saith
for a sin of divination `is' rebellion
And Saul saith unto Samuel
and now
And Samuel saith unto Saul
And Samuel turneth round to go
And Samuel saith unto him
and also
And he saith
And Samuel turneth back after Saul
and Samuel saith
And Samuel saith
And Samuel goeth to Ramath
And Samuel hath not added to see Saul till the day of his death
