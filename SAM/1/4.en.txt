And the word of Samuel is to all Israel
and the Philistines set themselves in array to meet Israel
And the people cometh in unto the camp
And the people sendeth to Shiloh
And it cometh to pass
And the Philistines hear the noise of the shouting
And the Philistines are afraid

And the Philistines fight
and the ark of God hath been taken
And a man of Benjamin runneth out of the ranks
and he cometh in
And Eli heareth the noise of the cry
And Eli is a son of ninety and eight years
And the man saith unto Eli
And he who is bearing tidings answereth and saith
And it cometh to pass
And his daughter-in-law
And at the time of her death
and she calleth the youth I-Chabod
And she saith
