And the ark of Jehovah is in the field of the Philistines seven months
and the Philistines call for priests and for diviners
And they say
And they say
and ye have made images of your emerods
and why do ye harden your heart as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their heart? do they not -- when He hath rolled Himself upon them -- send them away
`And now
and ye have taken the ark of Jehovah
and ye have seen
And the men do so
and they place the ark of Jehovah upon the cart
And the kine go straight in the way
And the Beth-Shemeshites are reaping their wheat-harvest in the valley
And the cart hath come in unto the field of Joshua the Beth-Shemeshite
And the Levites have taken down the ark of Jehovah
and the five princes of the Philistines have seen `it'
And these `are' the golden emerods which the Philistines have sent back -- a guilt-offering to Jehovah: for Ashdod one
and the golden mice -- the number of all the cities of the Philistines -- for the five princes
And He smiteth among the men of Beth-Shemesh
And the men of Beth-Shemesh say
And they send messengers unto the inhabitants of Kirjath-Jearim
