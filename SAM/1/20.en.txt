And David fleeth from Naioth in Ramah
And he saith to him
And David sweareth again
And Jonathan saith to David
And David saith unto Jonathan
if thy father at all look after me
If thus he say: Good; peace `is' for thy servant; and if it be very displeasing to him -- know that the evil hath been determined by him;"
and thou hast done kindness
And Jonathan saith
And David saith unto Jonathan
And Jonathan saith unto David
And Jonathan saith unto David
thus doth Jehovah do to Jonathan
and not only while I am alive dost thou do with me the kindness of Jehovah
but thou dost not cut off thy kindness from my house unto the age
And Jonathan covenanteth with the house of David
and Jonathan addeth to cause David to swear
And Jonathan saith to him
and on the third day thou dost certainly come down
`And I shoot three of the arrows at the side
and lo
And if thus I say to the young man
as to the thing which we have spoken
And David is hidden in the field
and the king sitteth on his seat
And Saul hath not spoken anything on that day
And it cometh to pass on the second morrow of the new moon
And Jonathan answereth Saul
and he saith
And the anger of Saul burneth against Jonathan
for all the days that the son of Jesse liveth on the ground thou art not established
And Jonathan answereth Saul his father
And Saul casteth the javelin at him to smite him
And Jonathan riseth from the table in the heat of anger
And it cometh to pass in the morning
And he saith to his youth
And the youth cometh unto the place of the arrow which Jonathan hath shot
and Jonathan calleth after the youth
And the youth hath not known anything
And Jonathan giveth his weapons unto the youth whom he hath
The youth hath gone
and Jonathan saith to David
