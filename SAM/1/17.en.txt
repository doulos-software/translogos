And the Philistines gather their camps to battle
and Saul and the men of Israel have been gathered
And the Philistines are standing on the mountain on this side
And there goeth out a man of the duellists from the camps of the Philistines
and a helmet of brass `is' on his head
and a frontlet of brass `is' on his feet
and the wood of his spear `is' like a beam of weavers'
And he standeth and calleth unto the ranks of Israel
if he be able to fight with me
And the Philistine saith
And Saul heareth -- and all Israel -- these words of the Philistine
And David `is' son of this Ephrathite of Beth-Lehem-Judah
and the three eldest sons of Jesse go
And David is the youngest
and David is going and returning from Saul
And the Philistine draweth nigh
And Jesse saith to David his son
and these ten cuttings of the cheese thou dost take in to the head of the thousand
And Saul
And David riseth early in the morning
and Israel and the Philistines set in array rank to meet rank."
And David letteth down the goods from off him on the hand of a keeper of the goods
And he is speaking with them
and all the men of Israel when they see the man flee from his presence
And the men of Israel say
And David speaketh unto the men who are standing by him
And the people speak to him according to this word
And Eliab
And David saith
And he turneth round from him unto another
And the words which David hath spoken are heard
and David saith unto Saul
And Saul saith unto David
And David saith unto Saul
and I have gone out after him
Both the lion and the bear hath thy servant smitten
And David saith
And Saul clotheth David with his long robe
And David girded his sword above his long robe
And he taketh his staff in his hand
And the Philistine goeth on
and the Philistine looketh attentively
And the Philistine saith unto David
and the Philistine saith unto David
And David saith unto the Philistine
This day doth Jehovah shut thee up into my hand -- and I have smitten thee
and all this assembly do know that not by sword and by spear doth Jehovah save
And it hath come to pass
and David putteth forth his hand unto the vessel
And David is stronger than the Philistine with a sling and with a stone
and David runneth and standeth over the Philistine
And the men of Israel rise -- also Judah -- and shout
and the sons of Israel turn back from burning after the Philistines
And David taketh the head of the Philistine
And when Saul seeth David going out to meet the Philistine
And the king saith
And when David turneth back from smiting the Philistine
and Saul saith unto him
