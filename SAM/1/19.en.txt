And Saul speaketh unto Jonathan his son
and Jonathan son of Saul delighted exceedingly in David
and I -- I go out
And Jonathan speaketh good of David unto Saul his father
yea
And Saul hearkeneth to the voice of Jonathan
And Jonathan calleth for David
And there addeth to be war
And a spirit of sadness `from' Jehovah is unto Saul
and Saul seeketh to smite with the javelin through David
And Saul sendeth messengers unto the house of David to watch him
And Michal causeth David to go down through the window
and Michal taketh the teraphim
And Saul sendeth messengers to take David
And Saul sendeth the messengers to see David
And the messengers come in
And Saul saith unto Michal
And David hath fled
And it is declared to Saul
And Saul sendeth messengers to take David
And they declare `it' to Saul
And he goeth -- he also -- to Ramath
And he goeth thither -- unto Naioth in Ramah
and he strippeth off -- he also -- his garments
