And Jehovah saith unto Samuel
And Samuel saith
and thou hast called for Jesse in the sacrifice
And Samuel doth that which Jehovah hath spoken
and he saith
And it cometh to pass
And Jehovah saith unto Samuel
And Jesse calleth unto Abinadab
And Jesse causeth Shammah to pass by
And Jesse causeth seven of his sons to pass by before Samuel
And Samuel saith unto Jesse
And he sendeth
And Samuel taketh the horn of oil
And the Spirit of Jehovah turned aside from Saul
and the servants of Saul say unto him
let our lord command
And Saul saith unto his servants
And one of the servants answereth and saith
And Saul sendeth messengers unto Jesse
And Jesse taketh an ass
And David cometh in unto Saul
And Saul sendeth unto Jesse
And it hath come to pass
