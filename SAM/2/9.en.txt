And David saith
And the house of Saul hath a servant
And the king saith
And the king saith to him
And king David sendeth
and Mephibosheth son of Jonathan
And David saith to him
And he boweth himself
And the king calleth unto Ziba servant of Saul
and thou hast served for him the land
And Ziba saith unto the king
And Mephibosheth hath a young son
And Mephibosheth is dwelling in Jerusalem
