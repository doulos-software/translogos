And it cometh to pass afterwards
And David goeth up thither
and his men who `are' with him hath David brought up -- a man and his household -- and they dwell in the cities of Hebron."
And the men of Judah come
And David sendeth messengers unto the men of Jabesh-Gilead
`And
and now
And Abner
and causeth him to reign over Gilead
A son of forty years
And the number of the days that David hath been king in Hebron
And Abner son of Ner goeth out
And Joab son of Zeruiah
And Abner saith unto Joab
And they rise and pass over
And they lay hold
and the battle is very hard on that day
And there are there three sons of Zeruiah
And Asahel pursueth after Abner
And Abner looketh behind him
And Abner saith to him
And Abner addeth again
And he refuseth to turn aside
And Joab and Abishai pursue after Abner
And the sons of Benjamin gather themselves together after Abner
and Abner calleth unto Joab
And Joab saith
And Joab bloweth with a trumpet
And Abner and his men have gone through the plain all that night
And Joab hath turned back from after Abner
and the servants of David have smitten of Benjamin
And they lift up Asahel
