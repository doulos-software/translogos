And David inspecteth the people who `are' with him
and David sendeth the third of the people by the hand of Joab
And the people say
And the king saith unto them
and the king chargeth Joab
And the people goeth out into the field to meet Israel
and smitten there are the people of Israel before the servants of David
and the battle is there scattered over the face of all the land
And Absalom meeteth before the servants of David
And one man seeth
And Joab saith to the man who is declaring `it' to him
And the man saith unto Joab
or I had done against my soul a vain thing
And Joab saith
And they go round -- ten youths bearing weapons of Joab -- and smite Absalom
And Joab bloweth with a trumpet
and they take Absalom and cast him in the forest unto the great pit
And Absalom hath taken
And Ahimaaz son of Zadok said
and Joab saith to him
And Joab saith to Cushi
And Ahimaaz son of Zadok addeth again
`And
And David is sitting between the two gates
And the watchman calleth
And the watchman seeth another man running
And the watchman saith
And Ahimaaz calleth and saith unto the king
And the king saith
And the king saith
And lo
And the king saith unto the Cushite
And the king trembleth
