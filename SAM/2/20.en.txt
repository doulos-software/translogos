And there hath been called there a man of worthlessness
And every man of Israel goeth up from after David
And David cometh in unto his house at Jerusalem
And the king saith unto Amasa
and Amasa goeth to call Judah
and David saith unto Abishai
And the men of Joab go out after him
they `are' near the great stone that `is' in Gibeon
And Joab saith to Amasa
and Amasa hath not been watchful of the sword that `is' in the hand of Joab
And a man hath stood by him
And Amasa is rolling himself in blood
When he hath been removed out of the highway
And he passeth over through all the tribes of Israel to Abel
and they go in and lay siege against him
And a wise woman calleth out of the city
And he cometh near unto her
and she speaketh
I `am' of the peaceable -- faithful ones of Israel; thou art seeking to destroy a city
And Joab answereth and saith
The matter `is' not so; for a man of the hill-country of Ephraim -- Sheba son of Bichri his name -- hath lifted up his hand against the king
And the woman cometh unto all the people in her wisdom
And Joab `is' over all the host of Israel
and Adoram `is' over the tribute
and Sheva `is' scribe
and also
