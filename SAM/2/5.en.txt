And all the tribes of Israel come unto David
also heretofore
And all the elders of Israel come unto the king
A son of thirty years `is' David in his being king; forty years he hath reigned;"
in Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months
And the king goeth
And David captureth the fortress of Zion
And David saith on that day
And David dwelleth in the fortress
and David goeth
And Hiram king of Tyre sendeth messengers unto David
and David knoweth that Jehovah hath established him for king over Israel
And David taketh again concubines and wives out of Jerusalem
And these `are' the names of those born to him in Jerusalem: Shammuah
and Ibhar
and Elishama
And the Philistines hear that they have anointed David for king over Israel
and the Philistines have come
And David asketh of Jehovah
And David cometh in to Baal-Perazim
And they forsake there their idols
And the Philistines add again to come up
and David asketh of Jehovah
and it cometh to pass
And David doth so
