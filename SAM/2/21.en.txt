And there is a famine in the days of David three years
And the king calleth for the Gibeonites
yea
And the Gibeonites say to him
And they say unto the king
let there be given to us seven men of his sons
and the king hath pity on Mephibosheth son of Jonathan
and the king taketh the two sons of Rizpah daughter of Aiah
and giveth them into the hand of the Gibeonites
And Rizpah daughter of Aiah taketh the sackcloth
And it is declared to David that which Rizpah daughter of Aiah
and David goeth and taketh the bones of Saul
and he bringeth up thence the bones of Saul
and bury the bones of Saul and of Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin
And again have the Philistines war with Israel
and Ishbi-Benob
and Abishai son of Zeruiah giveth help to him
And it cometh to pass afterwards
And the battle is again in Gob with the Philistines
And the battle is again in Gath
and he reproacheth Israel
these four have been born to the giant in Gath
