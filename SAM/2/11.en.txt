And it cometh to pass
and it cometh to pass
and David sendeth and inquireth about the woman
And David sendeth messengers
and the woman conceiveth
And David sendeth unto Joab
and Uriah cometh unto him
And David saith to Uriah
and Uriah lieth down at the opening of the king's house
And they declare to David
And Uriah saith unto David
And David saith unto Uriah
and David calleth for him
And it cometh to pass in the morning
and he writeth in the letter
And it cometh to pass in Joab's watching of the city
and the men of the city go out and fight with Joab
And Joab sendeth and declareth to David all the matters of the war
and commandeth the messenger
then
Who smote Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast on him a piece of a rider from the wall
And the messenger goeth
and the messenger saith unto David
and those shooting shoot at thy servants from off the wall
And David saith unto the messenger
And the wife of Uriah heareth that Uriah her husband `is' dead
and the mourning passeth by
