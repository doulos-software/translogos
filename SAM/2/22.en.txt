And David speaketh to Jehovah the words of this song in the day Jehovah hath delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies
and he saith: `Jehovah `is' my rock
My God `is' my rock -- I take refuge in Him; My shield
The Praised One
When the breakers of death compassed me
The cords of Sheol have surrounded me
In mine adversity I call Jehovah
And shake and tremble doth the earth
Gone up hath smoke by His nostrils. And fire from His mouth devoureth
And He inclineth heaven
And He rideth on a cherub
And He setteth darkness Round about Him -- tabernacles
From the brightness before Him Were brands of fire kindled!"
Thunder from the heavens doth Jehovah
And He sendeth forth arrows
And seen are the streams of the sea
He sendeth from above -- He taketh me
He delivereth me from my strong enemy
They are before me in a day of my calamity
And He bringeth me out to a large place
Jehovah recompenseth me
For I have kept the ways of Jehovah
For all His judgments `are' before me
And I am perfect before Him
And Jehovah returneth to me
With the kind Thou shewest Thyself kind
With the pure Thou shewest Thyself pure
And the poor people Thou dost save
For Thou `art' my lamp
For by Thee I run -- a troop
God! Perfect `is' His way
For who is God save Jehovah? And who a Rock save our God?"
God -- my bulwark
Making my feet like hinds
Teaching my hands for battle
And Thou givest to me the shield of Thy salvation
Thou enlargest my step under me
I pursue mine enemies and destroy them
And I consume them
And Thou girdest me `with' strength for battle
And mine enemies -- Thou givest to me the neck
They look
And I beat them as dust of the earth
And -- Thou dost deliver me From the strivings of my people
Sons of a stranger feign obedience to me
Sons of a stranger fade away
Jehovah liveth
God -- who is giving vengeance to me
And bringing me forth from mine enemies
Therefore I confess Thee
Magnifying the salvations of His king
