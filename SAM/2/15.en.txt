And it cometh to pass afterwards
and Absalom hath risen early
And Absalom saith unto him
And Absalom saith
And it hath come to pass
and Absalom doth according to this thing to all Israel who come in for judgment unto the king
And it cometh to pass
for a vow hath thy servant vowed in my dwelling in Geshur
And the king saith to him
and Absalom sendeth spies through all the tribes of Israel
And with Absalom have gone two hundred men
and Absalom sendeth Ahithophel the Gilonite
And he who is declaring tidings cometh in unto David
And David saith to all his servants who `are' with him in Jerusalem
And the servants of the king say unto the king
And the king goeth out
And the king goeth out
And all his servants are passing on at his side
And the king saith unto Ittai the Gittite
Yesterday `is' thy coming in
And Ittai answereth the king and saith
And David saith unto Ittai
And all the land are weeping -- a great voice
and lo
And the king saith to Zadok
and if thus He say
And the king saith unto Zadok the priest
see ye
And Zadok taketh back -- and Abiathar -- the ark of God to Jerusalem
And David is going up in the ascent of the olives
and David declared
And it cometh to pass
and David saith to him
and if to the city thou dost turn back
and are there not with thee there Zadok and Abiathar the priests? and it hath been
Lo
And Hushai
