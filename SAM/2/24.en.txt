And the anger of Jehovah addeth to burn against Israel
And the king saith unto Joab
And Joab saith unto the king
And the word of the king is severe towards Joab
and they pass over the Jordan
and they come in to Gilead
and they come in to the fortress of Tyre
And they go to and fro through all the land
and Joab giveth the account of the inspection of the people unto the king
And the heart of David smiteth him
And David riseth in the morning
`Go
And Gad cometh in unto David
And David saith unto Gad
And Jehovah giveth a pestilence on Israel from the morning even unto the time appointed
and the messenger putteth forth his hand to Jerusalem to destroy it
And David speaketh unto Jehovah
And Gad cometh in unto David on that day
and David goeth up
And Araunah looketh
And Araunah saith
And Araunah saith unto David
the whole hath Araunah given
And the king saith unto Araunah
and David buildeth there an altar to Jehovah
