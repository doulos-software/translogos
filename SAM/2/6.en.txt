And David gathered again every chosen one in Israel
and David riseth and goeth
And they cause the ark of God to ride on a new cart
and they lift it up from the house of Abinadab
and David and all the house of Israel are playing before Jehovah
And they come unto the threshing-floor of Nachon
and the anger of Jehovah burneth against Uzzah
And it is displeasing to David
and David feareth Jehovah on that day
And David hath not been willing to turn aside unto himself the ark of Jehovah
and the ark of Jehovah doth inhabit the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months
And it is declared to king David
And it cometh to pass
And David is dancing with all strength before Jehovah
and David and all the house of Israel are bringing up the ark of Jehovah with shouting
and it hath come to pass
And they bring in the ark of Jehovah
And David finisheth from causing to ascend the burnt-offering
and he apportioneth to all the people
And David turneth back to bless his house
And David saith unto Michal
and I have been more vile than this
As to Michal daughter of Saul
