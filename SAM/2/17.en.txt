And Ahithophel said unto Absalom
and come upon him
and I bring back all the people unto thee -- as the turning back of the whole `is' the man whom thou art seeking -- all the people are peace."
And the thing is right in the eyes of Absalom
And Absalom saith
And Hushai cometh in unto Absalom
And Hushai saith unto Absalom
And Hushai saith
lo
and he also
`So that I have counselled: Let all Israel be diligently gathered unto thee
and we have come in unto him in one of the places where he is found
And if unto a city he is gathered
And Absalom saith -- and all the men of Israel -- `Better `is' the counsel of Hushai the Archite than the counsel of Ahithophel;' and Jehovah willed to make void the good counsel of Ahithophel for the sake of Jehovah's bringing unto Absalom the evil."
And Hushai saith unto Zadok and unto Abiathar the priests
and now
And Jonathan and Ahimaaz are standing at En-Rogel
And a youth seeth them
and the woman taketh and spreadeth the covering over the face of the well
And the servants of Absalom come in unto the woman to the house
And it cometh to pass
And David riseth
And Ahithophel hath seen that his counsel was not done
And David came to Mahanaim
and Amasa hath Absalom set instead of Joab over the host
and Israel encampeth with Absalom `in' the land of Gilead."
And it cometh to pass at the coming in of David to Mahanaim
couch
and honey
