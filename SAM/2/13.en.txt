And it cometh to pass afterwards that Absalom son of David hath a fair sister
And Amnon hath distress -- even to become sick
And Amnon hath a friend
and saith to him
And Jonadab saith to him
And Amnon lieth down
And David sendeth unto Tamar
And Tamar goeth to the house of Amnon her brother
and taketh the frying-pan
And Amnon saith unto Tamar
and she bringeth nigh unto him to eat
And she saith to him
And I -- whither do I cause my reproach to go? and thou -- thou art as one of the fools in Israel; and now
And he hath not been willing to hearken to her voice
And Amnon hateth her -- a very great hatred -- that greater `is' the hatred with which he hath hated her than the love with which he loved her
And she saith to him
and calleth his young man
-- and upon her `is' a long coat
And Tamar taketh ashes for her head
and Absalom her brother saith unto her
And king David hath heard all these things
and Absalom hath not spoken with Amnon either evil or good
And it cometh to pass
And Absalom cometh unto the king
And the king saith unto Absalom
And Absalom saith
and Absalom urgeth on him
And Absalom commandeth his young men
And the young men of Absalom do to Amnon as Absalom commanded
And it cometh to pass -- they `are' in the way -- and the report hath come unto David
and the king riseth
And Jonadab son of Shimeah
and now
And Absalom fleeth
And Jonadab saith unto the king
And it cometh to pass at his finishing to speak
And Absalom hath fled
And Absalom hath fled
and `the soul of' king David determineth to go out unto Absalom
