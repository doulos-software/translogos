And the son of Saul heareth that Abner `is' dead in Hebron
And two men
and the Beerothites flee to Gittaim
And to Jonathan son of Saul `is' a son -- lame; he was a son of five years at the coming in of the rumour of `the death of' Saul and Jonathan
And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite
and thither they have come
yea
and bring in the head of Ish-Bosheth unto David in Hebron
And David answereth Rechab and Baanah his brother
when one is declaring to me
Also -- when wicked men have slain the righteous man in his own house
And David commandeth the young men
