And Joab son of Zeruial knoweth that the heart of the king `is' on Absalom
and Joab sendeth to Tekoah
and thou hast gone unto the king
And the woman of Tekoah speaketh unto the king
And the king saith to her
and thy maid-servant hath two sons; and they strive both of them in a field
and lo
And the king saith unto the woman
And the woman of Tekoah saith unto the king
And the king saith
And she saith
And the woman saith
And the woman saith
for we do surely die
`And now that I have come to speak unto the king my lord this word
for the king doth hearken to deliver his handmaid out of the paw of the man `seeking' to destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God
and thy maid-servant saith
And the king answereth and saith unto the woman
And the king saith
in order to bring round the appearance of the thing hath thy servant Joab done this thing
And the king saith unto Joab
And Joab falleth on his face to the earth
And Joab riseth and goeth to Geshur
and the king saith
And like Absalom there was no man `so' fair in all Israel
and in his polling his head -- and it hath been at the end of year by year that he polleth `it'
And there are born to Absalom three sons
And Absalom dwelleth in Jerusalem two years of days
and Absalom sendeth unto Joab
And he saith unto his servants
And Joab riseth and cometh unto Absalom in the house
And Absalom saith unto Joab
And Joab cometh unto the king
