And Jehovah sendeth Nathan unto David
The rich hath flocks and herds very many;"
And the poor one hath nothing
And there cometh a traveller to the rich man
And the anger of David burneth against the man exceedingly
and the ewe-lamb he doth repay fourfold
And Nathan saith unto David
and I give to thee the house of thy lord
`Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah
`And now
thus said Jehovah
for thou hast done `it' in secret
And David saith unto Nathan
only
And Nathan goeth unto his house
and David seeketh God for the youth
And the elders of his house rise against him
and it cometh to pass on the seventh day
And David seeth that his servants are whispering
And David riseth from the earth
And his servants say unto him
And he saith
and now
And David comforteth Bath-Sheba his wife
and sendeth by the hand of Nathan the prophet
And Joab fighteth against Rabbah of the Bene-Ammon
and Joab sendeth messengers unto David
and now
And David gathereth all the people
and he taketh the crown of their king from off his head
and the people who `are' in it he hath brought out
