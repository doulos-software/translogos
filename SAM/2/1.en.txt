And it cometh to pass
and it cometh to pass
And David saith to him
And David saith unto him
And David saith unto the youth who is declaring `it' to him
And the youth who is declaring `it' to him saith
and he turneth behind him
And he saith to me
`And he saith unto me
And I stand over him
And David taketh hold on his garments
and they mourn
And David saith unto the youth who is declaring `it' to him
And David saith unto him
And David calleth to one of the youths
and David saith unto him
And David lamenteth with this lamentation over Saul
and he saith to teach the sons of Judah `The Bow;' lo
`The Roebuck
Declare `it' not in Gath
Mountains of Gilboa! No dew nor rain be on you
From the blood of the wounded
Saul and Jonathan! They are loved and pleasant in their lives
Daughters of Israel! for Saul weep ye
How have the mighty fallen In the midst of the battle! Jonathan! on thy high places wounded!"
I am in distress for thee
How have the mighty fallen
