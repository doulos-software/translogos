And the war is long between the house of Saul and the house of David
And there are born to David sons in Hebron
and his second `is' Chileab
and the fourth `is' Adonijah son of Haggith
and the sixth `is' Ithream
And it cometh to pass
and Saul hath a concubine
And it is displeasing to Abner exceedingly
thus doth God to Abner
to cause the kingdom to pass over from the house of Saul
And he is not able any more to turn back Abner a word
And Abner sendeth messengers unto David for himself
And he saith
And David sendeth messengers unto Ish-Bosheth son of Saul
And Ish-Bosheth sendeth
and her husband goeth with her
And the word of Abner was with the elders of Israel
and now
And Abner speaketh also in the ears of Benjamin
and Abner cometh in unto David
And Abner saith unto David
And lo
and Joab and all the host that `is' with him have come
And Joab cometh unto the king
Thou hast known Abner son of Ner
And Joab goeth out from David
And Abner turneth back to Hebron
And David heareth afterwards and saith
it doth stay on the head of Joab
And Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner because that he put to death Asahel their brother
And David saith unto Joab
And they bury Abner in Hebron
and the king lamenteth for Abner
Thy hands not bound
And all the people come to cause David to eat bread while yet day
And all the people have discerned `it'
and all the people know
And the king saith unto his servants
and I to-day `am' tender
