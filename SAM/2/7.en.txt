And it cometh to pass
that the king saith unto Nathan the prophet
And Nathan saith unto the king
And it cometh to pass in that night
`Go
for I have not dwelt in a house even from the day of My bringing up the sons of Israel out of Egypt
During all `the time' that I have walked up and down among all the sons of Israel
and now
and I am with thee whithersoever thou hast gone
and I have appointed a place for My people
even from the day that I appointed judges over My people Israel; and I have given rest to thee from all thine enemies
`When thy days are full
He doth build a house for My Name
I am to him for a father
and My kindness doth not turn aside from him
and stedfast `is' thy house and thy kingdom unto the age before thee
According to all these words
And king David cometh in and sitteth before Jehovah
And yet this `is' little in Thine eyes
And what doth David add more to speak unto Thee? and Thou
Because of Thy word
Therefore Thou hast been great
`And who `is' as Thy people
Yea
`And now
And Thy Name is great unto the age
For Thou
And now
And now
