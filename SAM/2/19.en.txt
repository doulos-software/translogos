And it is declared to Joab
and the salvation on that day becometh mourning to all the people
And the people stealeth away
and the king hath covered his face
And Joab cometh in unto the king to the house
to love thine enemies
`And now
And the king riseth
And it cometh to pass
and Absalom whom we anointed over us `is' dead in battle
And king David sent unto Zadok and unto Abiathar the priests
my brethren ye `are'
And to Amasa say ye
And he inclineth the heart of all the men of Judah as one man
And the king turneth back
and Shimei son of Gera
and a thousand men `are' with him from Benjamin
And passed over hath the ferry-boat to carry over the household of the king
and saith unto the king
for thy servant hath known that I have sinned; and lo
And Abishai son of Zeruiah answereth and saith
And David saith
And the king saith unto Shimei
And Mephibosheth son of Saul hath come down to meet the king -- and he prepared not his feet
and it cometh to pass
And he saith
and he uttereth slander against thy servant unto my lord the king
for all the house of my father have been nothing except men of death before my lord the king
And the king saith to him
And Mephibosheth saith unto the king
And Barzillai the Gileadite hath gone down from Rogelim
and Barzillai `is' very aged
and the king saith unto Barzillai
And Barzillai saith unto the king
A son of eighty years I `am' to-day; do I know between good and evil? doth thy servant taste that which I am eating
As a little thing
Let
And the king saith
And all the people pass over the Jordan
And the king passeth over to Gilgal
And
And all the men of Judah answer against the men of Israel
And the men of Israel answer the men of Judah
