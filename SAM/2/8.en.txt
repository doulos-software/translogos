And it cometh to pass afterwards that David smiteth the Philistines
And he smiteth Moab
And David smiteth Hadadezer son of Rehob
and David captureth from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen
And Aram of Damascus cometh to give help to Hadadezer king of Zobah
and David putteth garrisons in Aram of Damascus
and David taketh the shields of gold which were on the servants of Hadadezer
and from Betah
And Toi king of Hamath heareth that David hath smitten all the force of Hadadezer
and Toi sendeth Joram his son unto king David to ask of him of welfare
also them did king David sanctify to Jehovah
of Aram
And David maketh a name in his turning back from his smiting Aram in the valley of Salt -- eighteen thousand;"
and he putteth in Edom garrisons -- in all Edom he hath put garrisons
And David reigneth over all Israel
and Joab son of Zeruiah `is' over the host
and Zadok son of Ahitub
and Benaiah son of Jehoiada `is over' both the Cherethite and the Pelethite
