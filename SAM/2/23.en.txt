And these `are' the last words of David: -- `The affirmation of David son of Jesse -- And the affirmation of the man raised up -- Concerning the Anointed of the God of Jacob
The Spirit of Jehovah hath spoken by me
He said -- the God of Israel -- to me
And as the light of morning he riseth
For -- not so `is' my house with God; For -- a covenant age-during He made with me
As to the worthless -- As a thorn driven away `are' all of them
And the man who cometh against them Is filled with iron and the staff of a spear
These `are' the names of the mighty ones whom David hath: sitting in the seat `is' the Tachmonite
And after him `is' Eleazar son of Dodo
he hath arisen
And after him `is' Shammah son of Agee the Hararite
and he stationeth himself in the midst of the portion
And three of the thirty heads go down and come unto the harvest
and David `is' then in a fortress
and David longeth and saith
And the three mighty ones cleave through the camp of the Philistines
and saith
And Abishai brother of Joab
Of the three is he not the honoured? and he becometh their head; and unto the `first' three he hath not come."
And Benaiah son of Jehoiada (son of a man of valour
And he hath smitten the Egyptian man
These `things' hath Benaiah son of Jehoiada done
Of the thirty he is honoured
Asahel brother of Joab `is' of the thirty; Elhanan son of Dodo of Beth-Lehem."
