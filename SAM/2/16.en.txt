And David hath passed on a little from the top
And the king saith unto Ziba
And the king saith
And the king saith to Ziba
And king David hath come in unto Bahurim
and he stoneth David with stones
And thus said Shimei in his reviling
Jehovah hath turned back on thee all the blood of the house of Saul
And Abishai son of Zeruiah saith unto the king
And the king saith
And David saith unto Abishai
it may be Jehovah doth look on mine affliction
And David goeth with his men in the way
And the king cometh in
And Absalom and all the people
and it cometh to pass
And Absalom saith unto Hushai
And Hushai saith unto Absalom
and secondly
And Absalom saith unto Ahithophel
And Ahithophel saith unto Absalom
And they spread out for Absalom the tent on the roof
And the counsel of Ahithophel which he counselled in those days `is' as `when' one inquireth at the word of God; so `is' all the counsel of Ahithophel both to David and to Absalom."
