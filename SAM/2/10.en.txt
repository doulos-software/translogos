And it cometh to pass afterwards
and David saith
And the heads of the Bene-Ammon say unto Hanun their lord
And Hanun taketh the servants of David
and they declare `it' to David
And the Bene-Ammon see that they have been abhorred by David
and David heareth
And the Bene-Ammon come out
and Joab seeth that the front of the battle hath been unto him before and behind
and the rest of the people he hath given into the hand of Abishai his brother
And he saith
be strong and strengthen thyself for our people
And Joab draweth nigh
and the Bene-Ammon have seen that Aram hath fled
And Aram seeth that it is smitten before Israel
and Hadadezer sendeth
And it is declared to David
and Aram fleeth from the presence of Israel
And all the kings -- servants of Hadadezer -- see that they have been smitten before Israel
