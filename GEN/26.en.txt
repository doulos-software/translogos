And there is a famine in the land
And Jehovah appeareth unto him
sojourn in this land
and I have multiplied thy seed as stars of the heavens
because that Abraham hath hearkened to My voice
And Isaac dwelleth in Gerar;"
and men of the place ask him of his wife
And it cometh to pass
And Abimelech calleth for Isaac
And Abimelech saith
and Abimelech commandeth all the people
And Isaac soweth in that land
and the man is great
and he hath possession of a flock
and all the wells which his father's servants digged in the days of Abraham his father
And Abimelech saith unto Isaac
and Isaac goeth from thence
and Isaac turneth back
And Isaac's servants dig in the valley
and shepherds of Gerar strive with shepherds of Isaac
and they dig another well
And he removeth from thence
And he goeth up from thence `to' Beer-Sheba
and Jehovah appeareth unto him during that night
and he buildeth there an altar
And Abimelech hath gone unto him from Gerar
and Isaac saith unto them
And they say
do not evil with us
And he maketh for them a banquet
and rise early in the morning
And it cometh to pass during that day that Isaac's servants come and declare to him concerning the circumstances of the well which they have digged
and he calleth it Shebah
And Esau is a son of forty years
and they are a bitterness of spirit to Isaac and to Rebekah."
