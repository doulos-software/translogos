And Rachel seeth that she hath not borne to Jacob
And Jacob's anger burneth against Rachel
And she saith
and she giveth to him Bilhah her maid-servant for a wife
and Bilhah conceiveth
and Rachel saith
And Bilhah
and Rachel saith
And Leah seeth that she hath ceased from bearing
and Zilpah
and Leah saith
And Zilpah
and Leah saith
And Reuben goeth in the days of wheat-harvest
And she saith to her
And Jacob cometh in from the field at evening; and Leah goeth to meet him
And God hearkeneth unto Leah
and Leah saith
And conceive again doth Leah
and Leah saith
and afterwards hath she born a daughter
And God remembereth Rachel
and she conceiveth and beareth a son
and she calleth his name Joseph
And it cometh to pass
give up my wives and my children
And Laban saith unto him
He saith also
And he saith unto him
for `it is' little which thou hast had at my appearance
And he saith
I pass through all thy flock to-day to turn aside from thence every sheep speckled and spotted
and my righteousness hath answered for me in the day to come
And Laban saith
and he turneth aside during that day the ring-straked and the spotted he-goats
and setteth a journey of three days between himself and Jacob; and Jacob is feeding the rest of the flock of Laban."
And Jacob taketh to himself a rod of fresh poplar
and setteth up the rods which he hath peeled in the gutters in the watering troughs (when the flock cometh in to drink)
and the flocks conceive at the rods
And the lambs hath Jacob parted
And it hath come to pass whenever the strong ones of the flock conceive
and when the flock is feeble
And the man increaseth very exceedingly
