And God saith unto Jacob
And Jacob saith unto his household
and we rise
And they give unto Jacob all the gods of the stranger that `are' in their hand
and they journey
And Jacob cometh in to Luz which `is' in the land of Canaan (it `is' Bethel)
and he buildeth there an altar
And Deborah
And God appeareth unto Jacob again
and God saith to him
And God saith to him
and the land which I have given to Abraham and to Isaac -- to thee I give it
And God goeth up from him
And Jacob setteth up a standing pillar in the place where He hath spoken with him
and Jacob calleth the name of the place where God spake with him Bethel."
And they journey from Bethel
and it cometh to pass
And it cometh to pass in the going out of her soul (for she died)
and Rachel dieth
and Jacob setteth up a standing pillar over her grave; which `is' the standing pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day."
And Israel journeyeth
and it cometh to pass in Israel's dwelling in that land
And the sons of Jacob are twelve. Sons of Leah: Jacob's first-born Reuben
Sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin."
And sons of Bilhah
And sons of Zilpah
And Jacob cometh unto Isaac his father
And the days of Isaac are a hundred and eighty years
and Isaac expireth
