And Joseph cometh
And out of his brethren he hath taken five men
and Pharaoh saith unto his brethren
and they say unto Pharaoh
And Pharaoh speaketh unto Joseph
the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land cause thy father and thy brethren to dwell -- they dwell in the land of Goshen
And Joseph bringeth in Jacob his father
And Pharaoh saith unto Jacob
And Jacob saith unto Pharaoh
And Jacob blesseth Pharaoh
And Joseph settleth his father and his brethren
and Joseph nourisheth his father
And there is no bread in all the land
and Joseph gathereth all the silver that is found in the land of Egypt
And the silver is consumed out of the land of Egypt
and Joseph saith
And they bring in their cattle unto Joseph
And that year is finished
why do we die before thine eyes
And Joseph buyeth all the ground of Egypt for Pharaoh
as to the people he hath removed them to cities from the `one' end of the border of Egypt even unto its `other' end."
Only the ground of the priests he hath not bought
And Joseph saith unto the people
and it hath come to pass in the increases
And they say
and Joseph setteth it for a statute unto this day
And Israel dwelleth in the land of Egypt
and Jacob liveth in the land of Egypt seventeen years
And the days of Israel are near to die
and I have lain with my fathers
and he saith
