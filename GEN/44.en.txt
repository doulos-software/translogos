And he commandeth him who `is' over his house
and my cup
The morning is bright
they have gone out of the city -- they have not gone far off -- and Joseph hath said to him who `is' over his house
Is not this that with which my lord drinketh? and he observeth diligently with it; ye have done evil `in' that which ye have done.'"
And he overtaketh them
and they say unto him
lo
with whomsoever of thy servants it is found
And he saith
and they hasten and take down each his bag to the earth
and he searcheth -- at the eldest he hath begun
and they rend their garments
And Judah -- his brethren also -- cometh in unto the house of Joseph
and Joseph saith to them
And Judah saith
and he saith
And Judah cometh nigh unto him
My lord hath asked his servants
and we say unto my lord
`And thou sayest unto thy servants
and we say unto my lord
and thou sayest unto thy servants
`And it cometh to pass
and our father saith
and we say
`And thy servant my father saith unto us
and the one goeth out from me
when ye have taken also this from my presence
`And now
then it hath come to pass when he seeth that the youth is not
for thy servant obtained the youth by surety from my father
`And now
for how do I go up unto my father
