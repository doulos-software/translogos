And Abraham journeyeth from thence toward the land of the south
and Abraham saith concerning Sarah his wife
And God cometh in unto Abimelech in a dream of the night
And Abimelech hath not drawn near unto her
hath not he himself said to me
And God saith unto him in the dream
and now send back the man's wife
And Abimelech riseth early in the morning
and Abimelech calleth for Abraham
Abimelech also saith unto Abraham
And Abraham saith
and also
and it cometh to pass
And Abimelech taketh sheep and oxen
and Abimelech saith
and to Sarah he hath said
And Abraham prayeth unto God
for Jehovah restraining had restrained every womb of the house of Abimelech
