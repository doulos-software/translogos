And Jehovah saith to Noah
of all the clean beasts thou dost take to thee seven pairs
also
for after other seven days I am sending rain on the earth forty days and forty nights
And Noah doth according to all that Jehovah hath commanded him:"
and Noah `is' a son of six hundred years
And Noah goeth in
of the clean beasts and of the beasts that `are' not clean
two by two they have come in unto Noah
And it cometh to pass
In the six hundredth year of the life of Noah
and the shower is on the earth forty days and forty nights."
In this self-same day went in Noah
they
And they come in unto Noah
and they that are coming in
And the deluge is forty days on the earth
and the waters are mighty
And the waters have been very very mighty on the earth
fifteen cubits upwards have the waters become mighty
and expire doth all flesh that is moving on the earth
all in whose nostrils `is' breath of a living spirit -- of all that `is' in the dry land -- have died."
And wiped away is all the substance that is on the face of the ground
and the waters are mighty on the earth a hundred and fifty days."
