And Jehovah appeareth unto him among the oaks of Mamre
and he lifteth up his eyes and looketh
And he saith
let
and I bring a piece of bread
And Abraham hasteth towards the tent
and Abraham ran unto the herd
and he taketh butter and milk
And they say unto him
and he saith
And Sarah is hearkening at the opening of the tent
and Abraham and Sarah `are' aged
and Sarah laugheth in her heart
And Jehovah saith unto Abraham
And Sarah denieth
And the men rise from thence
and Jehovah said
and Abraham certainly becometh a nation great and mighty
for I have known him
And Jehovah saith
I go down now
and the men turn from thence
And Abraham draweth nigh and saith
peradventure there are fifty righteous in the midst of the city; dost Thou also consume
Far be it from Thee to do according to this thing
And Jehovah saith
And Abraham answereth and saith
peradventure there are lacking five of the fifty righteous -- dost Thou destroy for five the whole of the city?' and He saith
And he addeth again to speak unto Him and saith
And he saith
And he saith
And he saith
And Jehovah goeth on
