And God blesseth Noah
and your fear and your dread is on every beast of the earth
Every creeping thing that is alive
only flesh in its life -- its blood -- ye do not eat."
`And only your blood for your lives do I require; from the hand of every living thing I require it
whoso sheddeth man's blood
And ye
And God speaketh unto Noah
`And I
and with every living creature which `is' with you
And I have established My covenant with you
And God saith
My bow I have given in the cloud
and it hath come to pass (in My sending a cloud over the earth) that the bow hath been seen in the cloud
and I have remembered My covenant which is between Me and you
and the bow hath been in the cloud
And God saith unto Noah
And the sons of Noah who are going out of the ark are Shem
These three `are' sons of Noah
And Noah remaineth a man of the ground
and drinketh of the wine
And Ham
And Shem taketh -- Japheth also -- the garment
And Noah awaketh from his wine
and saith: `Cursed `is' Canaan
And he saith: `Blessed of Jehovah my God `is' Shem
God doth give beauty to Japheth
And Noah liveth after the deluge three hundred and fifty years;"
and all the days of Noah are nine hundred and fifty years
