And the whole earth is of one pronunciation
and it cometh to pass
and they say each one to his neighbour
And they say
And Jehovah cometh down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men have builded;"
and Jehovah saith
Give help
And Jehovah doth scatter them from thence over the face of all the earth
therefore hath `one' called its name Babel
These `are' births of Shem: Shem `is' a son of an hundred years
And Shem liveth after his begetting Arphaxad five hundred years
And Arphaxad hath lived five and thirty years
And Arphaxad liveth after his begetting Salah four hundred and three years
And Salah hath lived thirty years
And Salah liveth after his begetting Eber four hundred and three years
And Eber liveth four and thirty years
And Eber liveth after his begetting Peleg four hundred and thirty years
And Peleg liveth thirty years
And Peleg liveth after his begetting Reu two hundred and nine years
And Reu liveth two and thirty years
And Reu liveth after his begetting Serug two hundred and seven years
And Serug liveth thirty years
And Serug liveth after his begetting Nahor two hundred years
And Nahor liveth nine and twenty years
And Nahor liveth after his begetting Terah an hundred and nineteen years
And Terah liveth seventy years
And these `are' births of Terah: Terah hath begotten Abram
and Haran dieth in the presence of Terah his father
And Abram and Nahor take to themselves wives; the name of Abram's wife `is' Sarai
And Sarai is barren -- she hath no child."
And Terah taketh Abram his son
And the days of Terah are two hundred and five years
