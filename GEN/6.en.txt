And it cometh to pass that mankind have begun to multiply on the face of the ground
and sons of God see the daughters of men that they `are' fair
And Jehovah saith
The fallen ones were in the earth in those days
And Jehovah seeth that abundant `is' the wickedness of man in the earth
and Jehovah repenteth that He hath made man in the earth
And Jehovah saith
And Noah found grace in the eyes of Jehovah."
These `are' births of Noah: Noah `is' a righteous man; perfect he hath been among his generations; with God hath Noah walked habitually."
And Noah begetteth three sons
And the earth is corrupt before God
And God seeth the earth
And God said to Noah
`Make for thyself an ark of gopher-wood; rooms dost thou make with the ark
and this `is' that which thou dost with it: three hundred cubits `is' the length of the ark
a window dost thou make for the ark
`And I
`And I have established My covenant with thee
and of all that liveth
Of the fowl after its kind
`And thou
And Noah doth according to all that God hath commanded him; so hath he done."
