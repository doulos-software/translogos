And Abram is a son of ninety and nine years
and I give My covenant between Me and thee
And Abram falleth upon his face
`I -- lo
and thy name is no more called Abram
and I have made thee exceeding fruitful
`And I have established My covenant between Me and thee
and I have given to thee
And God saith unto Abraham
this `is' My covenant which ye keep between Me and you
and ye have circumcised the flesh of your foreskin
`And a son of eight days is circumcised by you; every male to your generations
he is certainly circumcised who `is' born in thine house
and an uncircumcised one
And God saith unto Abraham
and I have blessed her
And Abraham falleth upon his face
And Abraham saith unto God
and God saith
As to Ishmael
and My covenant I establish with Isaac
and He finisheth speaking with him
And Abraham taketh Ishmael his son
And Abraham `is' a son of ninety and nine years in the flesh of his foreskin being circumcised;"
and Ishmael his son `is' a son of thirteen years in the flesh of his foreskin being circumcised;"
in this self-same day hath Abraham been circumcised
and all the men of his house -- born in the house
