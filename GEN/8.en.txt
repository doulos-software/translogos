And God remembereth Noah
and closed are the fountains of the deep and the net-work of the heavens
And turn back do the waters from off the earth
And the ark resteth
and the waters have been going and becoming lacking till the tenth month; in the tenth `month'
And it cometh to pass
and he sendeth forth the raven
And he sendeth forth the dove from him to see whether the waters have been lightened from off the face of the ground
and the dove hath not found rest for the sole of her foot
And he stayeth yet other seven days
and the dove cometh in unto him at even-time
And he stayeth yet other seven days
And it cometh to pass in the six hundredth and first year
And in the second month
And God speaketh unto Noah
every living thing that `is' with thee
and they have teemed in the earth
And Noah goeth out
every beast
And Noah buildeth an altar to Jehovah
and Jehovah smelleth the sweet fragrance
during all days of the earth
