And Sarai
and Sarai saith unto Abram
And Sarai
and he goeth in unto Hagar
And Sarai saith unto Abram
And Abram saith unto Sarai
And a messenger of Jehovah findeth her by the fountain of water in the wilderness
and he saith
And the messenger of Jehovah saith to her
and the messenger of Jehovah saith to her
and the messenger of Jehovah saith to her
and he is a wild-ass man
And she calleth the name of Jehovah who is speaking unto her
therefore hath one called the well
And Hagar beareth to Abram a son; and Abram calleth the name of his son
and Abram `is' a son of eighty and six years in Hagar's bearing Ishmael to Abram."
