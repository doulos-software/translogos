And the man knew Eve his wife
and she addeth to bear his brother
And it cometh to pass at the end of days that Cain bringeth from the fruit of the ground a present to Jehovah;"
and Abel
and unto Cain and unto his present He hath not looked; and it is very displeasing to Cain
And Jehovah saith unto Cain
Is there not
And Cain saith unto Abel his brother
And Jehovah saith unto Cain
And He saith
and now
when thou tillest the ground
And Cain saith unto Jehovah
lo
And Jehovah saith to him
And Cain goeth out from before Jehovah
and Cain knoweth his wife
And born to Enoch is Irad; and Irad hath begotten Mehujael; and Mehujael hath begotten Methusael; and Methusael hath begotten Lamech."
And Lamech taketh to himself two wives
And Adah beareth Jabal
and the name of his brother `is' Jubal
And Zillah she also bare Tubal-Cain
And Lamech saith to his wives: -- `Adah and Zillah
For sevenfold is required for Cain
And Adam again knoweth his wife
And to Seth
