And he heareth the words of Laban's sons
and Jacob seeth the face of Laban
And Jehovah saith unto Jacob
And Jacob sendeth and calleth for Rachel and for Leah to the field unto his flock;"
and saith to them
and ye -- ye have known that with all my power I have served your father
and your father hath played upon me
`If he say thus: The speckled are thy hire
and God taketh away the substance of your father
`And it cometh to pass at the time of the flock conceiving
and the messenger of God saith unto me in the dream
`And He saith
I `am' the God of Bethel where thou hast anointed a standing pillar
And Rachel answereth -- Leah also -- and saith to him
have we not been reckoned strangers to him? for he hath sold us
for all the wealth which God hath taken away from our father
And Jacob riseth
and leadeth all his cattle
And Laban hath gone to shear his flock
and Jacob deceiveth the heart of Laban the Aramaean
and he fleeth
And it is told to Laban on the third day that Jacob hath fled
and he taketh his brethren with him
And God cometh in unto Laban the Aramaean in a dream of the night
And Laban overtaketh Jacob; and Jacob hath fixed his tent in the mount; and Laban with his brethren have fixed `theirs' in the mount of Gilead."
And Laban saith to Jacob
Why hast thou hidden thyself to flee
and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? -- now thou hast acted foolishly in doing `so';"
my hand is to God to do evil with you
`And now
And Jacob answereth and saith to Laban
with whomsoever thou findest thy gods -- he doth not live; before our brethren discern for thyself what `is' with me
And Laban goeth into the tent of Jacob
And Rachel hath taken the teraphim
and she saith unto her father
And it is displeasing to Jacob
for thou hast felt all my vessels: what hast thou found of all the vessels of thy house? set here before my brethren
`These twenty years I `am' with thee: thy ewes and thy she-goats have not miscarried
the torn I have not brought in unto thee -- I
I have been `thus': in the day consumed me hath drought
`This `is' to me twenty years in thy house: I have served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters
unless the God of my father
And Laban answereth and saith unto Jacob
and now
And Jacob taketh a stone
and Jacob saith to his brethren
and Laban calleth it Jegar-Sahadutha; and Jacob hath called it Galeed."
And Laban saith
Mizpah also
if thou afflict my daughters
And Laban saith to Jacob
this heap `is' witness
the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor
And Jacob sacrificeth a sacrifice in the mount
and Laban riseth early in the morning
