And it cometh to pass after these things that God hath tried Abraham
And He saith
And Abraham riseth early in the morning
On the third day -- Abraham lifteth up his eyes
and Abraham saith unto his young men
And Abraham taketh the wood of the burnt-offering
And Isaac speaketh unto Abraham his father
and Abraham saith
And they come in unto the place of which God hath spoken to him
and Abraham putteth forth his hand
And the messenger of Jehovah calleth unto him from the heavens
and He saith
And Abraham lifteth up his eyes
and Abraham calleth the name of that place `Jehovah-Jireh
And the messenger of Jehovah calleth unto Abraham a second time from the heavens
and saith
that blessing I bless thee
and blessed themselves in thy seed have all nations of the earth
And Abraham turneth back unto his young men
And it cometh to pass after these things that it is declared to Abraham
Huz his first-born
and Chesed
and Bethuel hath begotten Rebekah;' these eight hath Milcah borne to Nahor
and his concubine
