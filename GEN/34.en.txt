And Dinah
and Shechem
and his soul cleaveth to Dinah
And Shechem speaketh unto Hamor his father
And Jacob hath heard that he hath defiled Dinah his daughter
And Hamor
and the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard
And Hamor speaketh with them
and join ye in marriage with us; your daughters ye give to us
and with us ye dwell
And Shechem saith unto her father
multiply on me exceedingly dowry and gift
And the sons of Jacob answer Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully
and say unto them
`Only for this we consent to you; if ye be as we
then we have given our daughters to you
and if ye hearken not unto us to be circumcised
And their words are good in the eyes of Hamor
and the young man delayed not to do the thing
And Hamor cometh -- Shechem his son also -- unto the gate of their city
`These men are peaceable with us; then let them dwell in the land
`Only for this do the men consent to us
their cattle
And unto Hamor
And it cometh to pass
and Hamor
Jacob's sons have come in upon the wounded
their flock and their herd
and all their wealth
And Jacob saith unto Simeon and unto Levi
And they say
