And it cometh to pass that Isaac `is' aged
And he saith
and now
and make for me tasteful things
And Rebekah is hearkening while Isaac is speaking unto Esau his son; and Esau goeth to the field to hunt provision -- to bring in;"
and Rebekah hath spoken unto Jacob her son
Bring for me provision
`And now
Go
and thou hast taken in to thy father
And Jacob saith unto Rebekah his mother
it may be my father doth feel me
and his mother saith to him
And he goeth
and Rebekah taketh the desirable garments of Esau her elder son
and the skins of the kids of the goats she hath put on his hands
and she giveth the tasteful things
And he cometh in unto his father
And Jacob saith unto his father
And Isaac saith unto his son
And Isaac saith unto Jacob
And Jacob cometh nigh unto Isaac his father
And he hath not discerned him
and saith
And he saith
And Isaac his father saith to him
and he cometh nigh
and God doth give to thee of the dew of heaven
peoples serve thee
And it cometh to pass
and he also maketh tasteful things
And Isaac his father saith to him
and Isaac trembleth a very great trembling
When Esau heareth the words of his father
and he saith
And he saith
And Isaac answereth and saith to Esau
And Esau saith unto his father
And Isaac his father answereth and saith unto him
and by thy sword dost thou live
And Esau hateth Jacob
And the words of Esau her elder son are declared to Rebekah
and now
and thou hast dwelt with him some days
till thy brother's anger turn back from thee
And Rebekah saith unto Isaac
