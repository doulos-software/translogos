And these `are' births of the sons of Noah
`Sons of Japheth `are' Gomer
And sons of Gomer `are' Ashkenaz
And sons of Javan `are' Elishah
By these have the isles of the nations been parted in their lands
And sons of Ham `are' Cush
And sons of Cush `are' Seba
And Cush hath begotten Nimrod;"
he hath begun to be a hero in the land; he hath been a hero in hunting before Jehovah; therefore it is said
And the first part of his kingdom is Babel
from that land he hath gone out to Asshur
and Resen
And Mitzraim hath begotten the Ludim
and the Pathrusim
And Canaan hath begotten Sidon his first-born
and the Jebusite
and the Hivite
and the Arvadite
And the border of the Canaanite is from Sidon
These `are' sons of Ham
As to Shem
Sons of Shem `are' Elam
And sons of Aram `are' Uz
And Arphaxad hath begotten Salah
And to Eber have two sons been born; the name of the one `is' Peleg (for in his days hath the earth been divided
And Joktan hath begotten Almodad
and Hadoram
and Obal
and Ophir
and their dwelling is from Mesha
These `are' sons of Shem
These `are' families of the sons of Noah
