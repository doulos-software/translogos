And Jacob hath gone on his way
and Jacob saith
And Jacob sendeth messengers before him unto Esau his brother
and commandeth them
and I have ox
And the messengers turn back unto Jacob
and Jacob feareth exceedingly
and saith
And Jacob saith
I have been unworthy of all the kind acts
`Deliver me
and Thou -- Thou hast said
And he lodgeth there during that night
she-goats two hundred
suckling camels and their young ones thirty
and he giveth into the hand of his servants
And he commandeth the first
then thou hast said
And he commandeth also the second
and ye have said also
and the present passeth over before his face
And he riseth in that night
and he taketh them
And Jacob is left alone
and he seeth that he is not able for him
and he saith
And he saith unto him
And he saith
And Jacob asketh
And Jacob calleth the name of the place Peniel: for `I have seen God face unto face
and the sun riseth on him when he hath passed over Penuel
therefore the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew which shrank
