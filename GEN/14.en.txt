And it cometh to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar
they have made war with Bera king of Sodom
All these have been joined together unto the valley of Siddim
twelve years they served Chedorlaomer
And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer
and the Horites in their mount Seir
and they turn back and come in unto En-Mishpat
And the king of Sodom goeth out
with Chedorlaomer king of Elam
And the valley of Siddim `is' full of bitumen-pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah flee
And they take the whole substance of Sodom and Gomorrah
and they take Lot
And one who is escaping cometh and declareth to Abram the Hebrew
And Abram heareth that his brother hath been taken captive
And he divideth himself against them by night
and he bringeth back the whole of the substance
And the king of Sodom goeth out to meet him (after his turning back from the smiting of Chedorlaomer
And Melchizedek king of Salem hath brought out bread and wine
and he blesseth him
and blessed `is' God Most High
And the king of Sodom saith unto Abram
and Abram saith unto the king of Sodom
from a thread even unto a shoe-latchet I take not of anything which thou hast
save only that which the young men have eaten
