And the life of Sarah is a hundred and twenty and seven years -- years of the life of Sarah;"
and Sarah dieth in Kirjath-Arba
And Abraham riseth up from the presence of his dead
`A sojourner and a settler I `am' with you; give to me a possession of a burying-place with you
And the sons of Heth answer Abraham
`Hear us
And Abraham riseth and boweth himself to the people of the land
and he speaketh with them
and he giveth to me the cave of Machpelah
And Ephron is sitting in the midst of the sons of Heth
`Nay
And Abraham boweth himself before the people of the land
and speaketh unto Ephron in the ears of the people of the land
And Ephron answereth Abraham
`My lord
And Abraham hearkeneth unto Ephron
And established are the field of Ephron
to Abraham by purchase
And after this hath Abraham buried Sarah his wife at the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (which `is' Hebron)
and established are the field
