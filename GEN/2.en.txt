And the heavens and the earth are completed
and God completeth by the seventh day His work which He hath made
And God blesseth the seventh day
These `are' births of the heavens and of the earth in their being prepared
and no shrub of the field is yet in the earth
and a mist goeth up from the earth
And Jehovah God formeth the man -- dust from the ground
And Jehovah God planteth a garden in Eden
and Jehovah God causeth to sprout from the ground every tree desirable for appearance
And a river is going out from Eden to water the garden
the name of the one `is' Pison
and the gold of that land `is' good
and the name of the second river `is' Gibon
and the name of the third river `is' Hiddekel
And Jehovah God taketh the man
And Jehovah God layeth a charge on the man
and of the tree of knowledge of good and evil
And Jehovah God saith
And Jehovah God formeth from the ground every beast of the field
And the man calleth names to all the cattle
And Jehovah God causeth a deep sleep to fall upon the man
And Jehovah God buildeth up the rib which He hath taken out of the man into a woman
and the man saith
therefore doth a man leave his father and his mother
And they are both of them naked
