And Jacob calleth unto his sons and saith
`Be assembled
Reuben! my first-born thou
Unstable as water
Simeon and Levi `are' brethren! Instruments of violence -- their espousals!"
Into their secret
Cursed `is' their anger
Judah! thou -- thy brethren praise thee! Thy hand `is' on the neck of thine enemies
A lion's whelp `is' Judah
The sceptre turneth not aside from Judah
Binding to the vine his ass
Red `are' eyes with wine
Zebulun at a haven of the seas doth dwell
Issacher `is' a strong ass
And he seeth rest that `it is' good
Dan doth judge his people
Dan is a serpent by the way
For Thy salvation I have waited
Gad! a troop assaulteth him
Out of Asher his bread `is' fat; And he giveth dainties of a king."
Naphtali `is' a hind sent away
Joseph `is' a fruitful son; A fruitful son by a fountain
And embitter him -- yea
And his bow abideth in strength
By the God of thy father who helpeth thee
Thy father's blessings have been mighty Above the blessings of my progenitors
Benjamin! a wolf teareth; In the morning he eateth prey
All these `are' the twelve tribes of Israel
And he commandeth them
in the cave which `is' in the field of Machpelah
(there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah);"
the purchase of the field and of the cave which `is' in it
And Jacob finisheth commanding his sons
