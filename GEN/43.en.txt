And the famine `is' severe in the land;"
and it cometh to pass
And Judah speaketh unto him
if thou art sending our brother with us
and if thou art not sending -- we do not go down
And Israel saith
and they say
And Judah saith unto Israel his father
I -- I am surety `for' him
for if we had not lingered
And Israel their father saith unto them
and double money take in your hand
`And take your brother
and God Almighty give to you mercies before the man
And the men take this present
and Joseph seeth Benjamin with them
And the man doth as Joseph hath said
and the men are afraid because they have been brought into the house of Joseph
And they come nigh unto the man who `is' over the house of Joseph
and say
and it cometh to pass
and other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food; we have not known who put our money in our bags.'"
And he saith
And the man bringeth in the men into Joseph's house
and they prepare the present until the coming of Joseph at noon
And Joseph cometh into the house
and he asketh of them of peace
and they say
And he lifteth up his eyes
And Joseph hasteth
and he washeth his face
And they place for him by himself
And they sit before him
and he lifteth up gifts from before him unto them
