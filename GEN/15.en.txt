After these things hath the word of Jehovah been unto Abram in a vision
And Abram saith
And Abram saith
And lo
and He bringeth him out without
And he hath believed in Jehovah
And He saith unto him
and he saith
And He saith unto him
and he taketh to him all these
and the ravenous birds come down upon the carcases
And the sun is about to go in
and He saith to Abram
and the nation also whom they serve I judge
and thou -- thou comest in unto thy fathers in peace; thou art buried in a good old age;"
and the fourth generation doth turn back hither
And it cometh to pass -- the sun hath gone in
In that day hath Jehovah made with Abram a covenant
with the Kenite
and the Hittite
and the Amorite
