And Isaac calleth unto Jacob
rise
and God Almighty doth bless thee
and He doth give to thee the blessing of Abraham
And Isaac sendeth away Jacob
And Esau seeth that Isaac hath blessed Jacob
that Jacob hearkeneth unto his father and unto his mother
and Esau seeth that the daughters of Canaan are evil in the eyes of Isaac his father
and Esau goeth unto Ishmael
And Jacob goeth out from Beer-Sheba
and he toucheth at a `certain' place
And he dreameth
and lo
and thy seed hath been as the dust of the land
`And lo
And Jacob awaketh out of his sleep
and he feareth
And Jacob riseth early in the morning
and he calleth the name of that place Bethel
And Jacob voweth a vow
when I have turned back in peace unto the house of my father
then this stone which I have made a standing pillar is a house of God
