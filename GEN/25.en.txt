And Abraham addeth and taketh a wife
and she beareth to him Zimran
And Jokshan hath begotten Sheba and Dedan; and the sons of Dedan were Asshurim
and the sons of Midian `are' Ephah
And Abraham giveth all that he hath to Isaac;"
and to the sons of the concubines whom Abraham hath
And these `are' the days of the years of the life of Abraham
and Abraham expireth
And Isaac and Ishmael his sons bury him at the cave of Machpelah
the field which Abraham bought from the sons of Heth -- there hath Abraham been buried
And it cometh to pass after the death of Abraham
And these `are' births of Ishmael
and these `are' the names of the sons of Ishmael
and Mishma
Hadar
these are sons of Ishmael
And these `are' the years of the life of Ishmael
and they tabernacle from Havilah unto Shur
And these `are' births of Isaac
and Isaac is a son of forty years in his taking Rebekah
And Isaac maketh entreaty to Jehovah before his wife
and the children struggle together within her
And Jehovah saith to her
And her days to bear are fulfilled
and the first cometh out all red as a hairy robe
and afterwards hath his brother come out
And the youths grew
and Isaac loveth Esau
And Jacob boileth pottage
and Esau saith unto Jacob
and Jacob saith
And Esau saith
and Jacob saith
and Jacob hath given to Esau bread and pottage of lentiles
