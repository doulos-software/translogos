And Jacob lifteth up his feet
and he looketh
(When thither have all the droves been gathered
And Jacob saith to them
And he saith to them
And he saith to them
And he saith
And they say
He is yet speaking with them
and it cometh to pass when Jacob hath seen Rachel
And Jacob kisseth Rachel
and Jacob declareth to Rachel that he `is' her father's brother
And it cometh to pass
and Laban saith to him
And Laban saith to Jacob
And Laban hath two daughters
and the eyes of Leah `are' tender
And Jacob loveth Rachel
and Laban saith
and Jacob serveth for Rachel seven years; and they are in his eyes as some days
And Jacob saith unto Laban
and Laban gathereth all the men of the place
And it cometh to pass in the evening
and Laban giveth to her Zilpah
And it cometh to pass in the morning
And Laban saith
fulfil the week of this one
And Jacob doth so
and Laban giveth to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his maid-servant
And he goeth in also unto Rachel
And Jehovah seeth that Leah `is' the hated one
and Leah conceiveth
And she conceiveth again
And she conceiveth again
And she conceiveth again
