And Joseph falleth on his father's face
and Joseph commandeth his servants
and they fulfil for him forty days
And the days of his weeping pass away
My father caused me to swear
and Pharaoh saith
And Joseph goeth up to bury his father
and all the house of Joseph
and there go up with him both chariot and horsemen
And they come unto the threshing-floor of Atad
and the inhabitant of the land
And his sons do to him so as he commanded them
and his sons bear him away to the land of Canaan
And Joseph turneth back to Egypt
And the brethren of Joseph see that their father is dead
And they give a charge for Joseph
Thus ye do say to Joseph
And his brethren also go and fall before him
And Joseph saith unto them
As for you
and now
And Joseph dwelleth in Egypt
and Joseph looketh on Ephraim's sons of the third `generation'; sons also of Machir
And Joseph saith unto his brethren
And Joseph causeth the sons of Israel to swear
And Joseph dieth
