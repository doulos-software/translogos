And two of the messengers come towards Sodom at even
and he saith
And he presseth on them greatly
Before they lie down
and they call unto Lot and say to him
And Lot goeth out unto them
and saith
lo
And they say
And the men put forth their hand
and the men who `are' at the opening of the house they have smitten with blindness
And the men say unto Lot
for we are destroying this place
And Lot goeth out
And when the dawn hath ascended
And he lingereth
And it cometh to pass when he hath brought them out without
And Lot saith unto them
lo
lo
And he saith unto him
haste
The sun hath gone out on the earth
and Jehovah hath rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah
and He overthroweth these cities
And his wife looketh expectingly from behind him
And Abraham riseth early in the morning
and he looketh on the face of Sodom and Gomorrah
And it cometh to pass
And Lot goeth up out of Zoar
And the first-born saith unto the younger
come
And they cause their father to drink wine on that night; and the first-born goeth in
And it cometh to pass
And they cause their father to drink wine on that night also
And the two daughters of Lot conceive from their father
and the first-born beareth a son
as to the younger
