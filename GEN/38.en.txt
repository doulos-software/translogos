And it cometh to pass
and Judah seeth there the daughter of a man
And she conceiveth
and she conceiveth again
and she addeth again
And Judah taketh a wife for Er
and Er
And Judah saith to Onan
and Onan knoweth that the seed is not `reckoned' his; and it hath come to pass
and that which he hath done is evil in the eyes of Jehovah
And Judah saith to Tamar his daughter-in-law
And the days are multiplied
And it is declared to Tamar
and she turneth aside the garments of her widowhood from off her
And Judah seeth her
and he turneth aside unto her by the way
and he saith
and he saith
and she riseth
And Judah sendeth the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite
And he asketh the men of her place
And he turneth back unto Judah
and Judah saith
And it cometh to pass about three months `after'
She is brought out
And Judah discerneth and saith
And it cometh to pass in the time of her bearing
and it cometh to pass in her bearing
And it cometh to pass as he draweth back his hand
and afterwards hath his brother come out
