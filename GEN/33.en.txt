And Jacob lifteth up his eyes
and he setteth the maid-servants and their children first
And he himself passed over before them
and Esau runneth to meet him
and he lifteth up his eyes
And the maid-servants draw nigh
and Leah also draweth nigh
And he saith
And Esau saith
And Jacob saith
receive
and saith
And he saith unto him
Let my lord
And Esau saith
And turn back on that day doth Esau on his way to Seir;"
and Jacob hath journeyed to Succoth
And Jacob cometh in to Shalem
and he buyeth the portion of the field where he hath stretched out his tent
and he setteth up there an altar
