And it cometh to pass
and lo
and lo
and the kine of bad appearance and lean `in' flesh eat up the seven kine of fair appearance
And he sleepeth
and lo
and the thin ears swallow the seven fat and full ears -- and Pharaoh awaketh
And it cometh to pass in the morning
And the chief of the butlers speaketh with Pharaoh
Pharaoh hath been wroth against his servants
and we dream a dream in one night
And there `is' with us a youth
and it cometh to pass
And Pharaoh sendeth and calleth Joseph
And Pharaoh saith unto Joseph
and Joseph answereth Pharaoh
And Pharaoh speaketh unto Joseph: `In my dream
and lo
and lo
`And the lean and the bad kine eat up the first seven fat kine
and they come in unto their midst
`And I see in my dream
and lo
and the thin ears swallow the seven good ears; and I tell unto the scribes
And Joseph saith unto Pharaoh
the seven good kine are seven years
and the seven thin and bad kine which are coming up after them are seven years
this `is' the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: That which God is doing
`Lo
and seven years of famine have arisen after them
and the plenty is not known in the land because of that famine afterwards
`And because of the repeating of the dream unto Pharaoh twice
`And now
let Pharaoh make and appoint overseers over the land
and they gather all the food of these good years that are coming
and the food hath been for a store for the land
And the thing is good in the eyes of Pharaoh
and Pharaoh saith unto his servants
and Pharaoh saith unto Joseph
thou -- thou art over my house
And Pharaoh saith unto Joseph
And Pharaoh turneth aside his seal-ring from off his hand
and causeth him to ride in the second chariot which he hath
And Pharaoh saith unto Joseph
and Pharaoh calleth Joseph's name Zaphnath-Paaneah
And Joseph `is' a son of thirty years in his standing before Pharaoh king of Egypt
and the land maketh in the seven years of plenty by handfuls."
And he gathereth all the food of the seven years which have been in the land of Egypt
and Joseph gathereth corn as sand of the sea
And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine cometh
and Joseph calleth the name of the first-born Manasseh: `for
and the name of the second he hath called Ephraim: `for
And the seven years of plenty are completed which have been in the land of Egypt
and the seven years of famine begin to come
and all the land of Egypt is famished
And the famine has been over all the face of the land
and all the earth hath come to Egypt
