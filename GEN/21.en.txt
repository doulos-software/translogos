And Jehovah hath looked after Sarah as He hath said
and Sarah conceiveth
and Abraham calleth the name of his son who is born to him
and Abraham circumciseth Isaac his son
And Abraham `is' a son of a hundred years in Isaac his son being born to him
and Sarah saith
She saith also
And the lad groweth
and Sarah seeth the son of Hagar the Egyptian
and she saith to Abraham
And the thing is very wrong in the eyes of Abraham
and God saith unto Abraham
As to the son of the handmaid also
And Abraham riseth early in the morning
and the water is consumed from the bottle
And she goeth and sitteth by herself over-against
And God heareth the voice of the youth; and the messenger of God calleth unto Hagar from the heavens
rise
And God openeth her eyes
and God is with the youth
and he dwelleth in the wilderness of Paran
And it cometh to pass at that time that Abimelech speaketh -- Phichol also
and now
And Abraham saith
And Abraham reasoned with Abimelech concerning the matter of a well of water which Abimelech's servants have taken violently away
and Abimelech saith
And Abraham taketh sheep and oxen
and Abraham setteth seven Lambs of the flock by themselves."
And Abimelech saith unto Abraham
And he saith
therefore hath he called that place `Beer-Sheba
And they make a covenant in Beer-Sheba
and `Abraham' planteth a tamarask in Beer-Sheba
and Abraham sojourneth in the land of the Philistines many days."
