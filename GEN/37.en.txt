And Jacob dwelleth in the land of his father's sojournings -- in the land of Canaan."
These `are' births of Jacob: Joseph
And Israel hath loved Joseph more than any of his sons
and his brethren see that their father hath loved him more than any of his brethren
And Joseph dreameth a dream
And he saith unto them
that
And his brethren say to him
And he dreameth yet another dream
And he recounteth unto his father
and his brethren are zealous against him
And his brethren go to feed the flock of their father in Shechem
and Israel saith unto Joseph
and he saith to him
And a man findeth him
and he saith
And the man saith
And they see him from afar
And they say one unto another
and now
And Reuben heareth
and Reuben saith unto them
And it cometh to pass
and take him and cast him into the pit
And they sit down to eat bread
And Judah saith unto his brethren
Come
And Midianite merchantmen pass by and they draw out and bring up Joseph out of the pit
And Reuben returneth unto the pit
and he returneth unto his brethren
And they take the coat of Joseph
and send the long coat
And he discerneth it
And Jacob rendeth his raiment
and all his sons and all his daughters rise to comfort him
And the Medanites have sold him unto Egypt
