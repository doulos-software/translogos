And Jehovah saith unto Abram
And I make thee become a great nation
And I bless those blessing thee
And Abram goeth on
And Abram taketh Sarai his wife
And Abram passeth over into the land
And Jehovah appeareth unto Abram
And he removeth from thence towards a mountain at the east of Beth-El
And Abram journeyeth
And there is a famine in the land
and it cometh to pass as he hath drawn near to enter Egypt
and it hath come to pass that the Egyptians see thee
say
And it cometh to pass
and princes of Pharaoh see her
and to Abram he hath done good because of her
And Jehovah plagueth Pharaoh and his house -- great plagues -- for the matter of Sarai
And Pharaoh calleth for Abram
Why hast thou said
And Pharaoh chargeth men concerning him
