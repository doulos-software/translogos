And the serpent hath been subtile above every beast of the field which Jehovah God hath made
And the woman saith unto the serpent
and of the fruit of the tree which `is' in the midst of the garden God hath said
And the serpent saith unto the woman
for God doth know that in the day of your eating of it -- your eyes have been opened
And the woman seeth that the tree `is' good for food
and the eyes of them both are opened
And they hear the sound of Jehovah God walking up and down in the garden at the breeze of the day
And Jehovah God calleth unto the man
and he saith
And He saith
and the man saith
And Jehovah God saith to the woman
And Jehovah God saith unto the serpent
and enmity I put between thee and the woman
Unto the woman He said
And to the man He said
and thorn and bramble it doth bring forth to thee
by the sweat of thy face thou dost eat bread till thy return unto the ground
And the man calleth his wife's name Eve: for she hath been mother of all living."
And Jehovah God doth make to the man and to his wife coats of skin
And Jehovah God saith
Jehovah God sendeth him forth from the garden of Eden to serve the ground from which he hath been taken;"
yea
