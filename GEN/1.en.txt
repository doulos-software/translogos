In the beginning of God's preparing the heavens and the earth --"
the earth hath existed waste and void
and God saith
And God seeth the light that `it is' good
and God calleth to the light `Day
And God saith
And God maketh the expanse
And God calleth to the expanse `Heavens;' and there is an evening
And God saith
And God calleth to the dry land `Earth
And God saith
And the earth bringeth forth tender grass
and there is an evening
And God saith
and they have been for luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth:' and it is so."
And God maketh the two great luminaries
and God giveth them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth
and to rule over day and over night
and there is an evening
And God saith
And God prepareth the great monsters
And God blesseth them
and there is an evening
And God saith
And God maketh the beast of the earth after its kind
And God saith
And God prepareth the man in His image; in the image of God He prepared him
And God blesseth them
And God saith
and to every beast of the earth
And God seeth all that He hath done
