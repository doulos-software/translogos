And it cometh to pass
and Pharaoh is wroth against his two eunuchs
and giveth them in charge in the house of the chief of the executioners
and the chief of the executioners chargeth Joseph with them
And they dream a dream both of them
And Joseph cometh in unto them in the morning
and he asketh Pharaoh's eunuchs who `are' with him in charge in the house of his lord
And they say unto him
And the chief of the butlers recounteth his dream to Joseph
and in the vine `are' three branches
and Pharaoh's cup `is' in my hand
And Joseph saith to him
yet
`Surely if thou hast remembered me with thee
for I was really stolen from the land of the Hebrews; and here also have I done nothing that they have put me in the pit.'"
And the chief of the bakers seeth that he hath interpreted good
and in the uppermost basket `are' of all `kinds' of Pharaoh's food
And Joseph answereth and saith
yet
And it cometh to pass
and he putteth back the chief of the butlers to his butlership
and the chief of the bakers he hath hanged
and the chief of the butlers hath not remembered Joseph
