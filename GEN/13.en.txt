And Abram goeth up from Egypt (he and his wife
and Abram `is' exceedingly wealthy in cattle
And he goeth on his journeyings from the south
unto the place of the altar which he made there at the first
And also to Lot
and the land hath not suffered them to dwell together
and there is a strife between those feeding Abram's cattle and those feeding Lot's cattle; and the Canaanite and the Perizzite `are' then dwelling in the land."
And Abram saith unto Lot
Is not all the land before thee? be parted
And Lot lifteth up his eyes
and Lot chooseth for himself the whole circuit of the Jordan; and Lot journeyeth from the east
Abram hath dwelt in the land of Canaan
and the men of Sodom `are' evil
And Jehovah said unto Abram
for the whole of the land which thou are seeing
And I have set thy seed as dust of the earth
rise
And Abram tenteth
