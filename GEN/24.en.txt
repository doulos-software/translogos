And Abraham `is' old
and Abraham saith unto his servant
and I cause thee to swear by Jehovah
but unto my land and unto my kindred dost thou go
And the servant saith unto him
And Abraham saith unto him
Jehovah
and if the woman be not willing to come after thee
And the servant putteth his hand under the thigh of Abraham his lord
And the servant taketh ten camels of the camels of his lord and goeth
and he causeth the camels to kneel at the outside of the city
And he saith
lo
and it hath been
And it cometh to pass
and the young person `is' of very good appearance
And the servant runneth to meet her
and she saith
And she finisheth giving him drink
and she hasteth
And the man
And it cometh to pass when the camels have finished drinking
and saith
And she saith unto him
She saith also unto him
And the man boweth
and saith
And the young person runneth
And Rebekah hath a brother
yea
And he saith
And he bringeth in the man into the house
and setteth before him to eat; but he saith
And he saith
and Jehovah hath blessed my lord exceedingly
and Sarah
`And my lord causeth me to swear
If not -- unto the house of my father thou dost go
`And I say unto my lord
and he saith unto me
then art thou acquitted from my oath
`And I come to-day unto the fountain
(lo
and she hath said unto me
`Before I finish speaking unto my heart
and she hasteth and letteth down her pitcher from off her and saith
`And I ask her
and I bow
`And now
And Laban answereth -- Bethuel also -- and they say
lo
And it cometh to pass
and the servant taketh out vessels of silver
And they eat and drink
and her brother saith -- her mother also -- `Let the young person abide with us a week or ten days
And he saith unto them
and they say
and they call for Rebekah
And they send away Rebekah their sister
and they bless Rebekah
And Rebekah and her young women arise
And Isaac hath come in from the entrance of the Well of the Living One
and Isaac goeth out to meditate in the field
And Rebekah lifteth up her eyes
and she saith unto the servant
And the servant recounteth to Isaac all the things that he hath done
and Isaac bringeth her in unto the tent of Sarah his mother
