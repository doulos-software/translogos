And it cometh to pass
And `one' declareth to Jacob
And Jacob saith unto Joseph
and saith unto me
`And now
and thy family which thou hast begotten after them are thine; by the name of their brethren they are called in their inheritance."
`And I -- in my coming in from Padan-`Aram' Rachel hath died by me in the land of Canaan
And Israel seeth the sons of Joseph
and Joseph saith unto his father
And the eyes of Israel have been heavy from age
and Israel saith unto Joseph
And Joseph bringeth them out from between his knees
and Joseph taketh them both
And Israel putteth out his right hand
And he blesseth Joseph
the Messenger who is redeeming me from all evil doth bless the youths
And Joseph seeth that his father setteth his right hand on the head of Ephraim
and Joseph saith unto his father
And his father refuseth
and he blesseth them in that day
And Israel saith unto Joseph
and I -- I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren
