And Joseph hath been brought down to Egypt
And Jehovah is with Joseph
and his lord seeth that Jehovah is with him
and Joseph findeth grace in his eyes and serveth him
And it cometh to pass from the time that he hath appointed him over his house
and he leaveth all that he hath in the hand of Joseph
And it cometh to pass after these things
and he refuseth
none is greater in this house than I
And it cometh to pass at her speaking unto Joseph day `by' day
and it cometh to pass about this day
and she catcheth him by his garment
And it cometh to pass when she seeth that he hath left his garment in her hand
that she calleth for the men of her house
and it cometh to pass
And she placeth his garment near her
And she speaketh unto him according to these words
and it cometh to pass
And it cometh to pass when his lord heareth the words of his wife
and Joseph's lord taketh him
And Jehovah is with Joseph
and the chief of the round-house giveth into the hand of Joseph all the prisoners who `are' in the round-house
the chief of the round-house seeth not anything under his hand
