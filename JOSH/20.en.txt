And Jehovah speaketh unto Joshua
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
for the fleeing thither of a man-slayer smiting life inadvertently
`When `one' hath fled unto one of these cities
`And when the redeemer of blood doth pursue after him
and he hath dwelt in that city till his standing before the company for judgment
And they sanctify Kedesh in Galilee
and beyond the Jordan
These have been cities of meeting for all the sons of Israel
