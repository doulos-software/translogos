And Jehovah saith unto Joshua
and thou hast done to Ai and to her king as thou hast done to Jericho and to her king; only
And Joshua riseth
and commandeth them
and I and all the people who `are' with me draw near unto the city
and they have come out after us till we have drawn them out of the city
and ye rise from the ambush
and it hath been
And Joshua sendeth them away
And Joshua riseth early in the morning
and all the people of war who `are' with him have gone up
And he taketh about five thousand men
and they set the people
And it cometh to pass
And Joshua and all Israel `seem' stricken before them
and all the people who `are' in the city are called to pursue after them
and there hath not been left a man in Ai and Bethel who hath not gone out after Israel
And Jehovah saith unto Joshua
and the ambush hath risen `with' haste
And the men of Ai look behind them
and Joshua and all Israel have seen that the ambush hath captured the city
and these have come out from the city to meet them
and the king of Ai they caught alive
And it cometh to pass
and all who fall during the day
And Joshua hath not brought back his hand which he stretched out with the javelin till that he hath devoted all the inhabitants of Ai;"
only
And Joshua burneth Ai
and the king of Ai he hath hanged on the tree till even-time
Then doth Joshua build an altar to Jehovah
as Moses
and he writeth there on the stones the copy of the law of Moses
And all Israel
And afterwards he hath proclaimed all the words of the law
there hath not been a thing of all that Moses commanded which Joshua hath not proclaimed before all the assembly of Israel
