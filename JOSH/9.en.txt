And it cometh to pass
that they gather themselves together to fight with Joshua
And the inhabitants of Gibeon have heard that which Joshua hath done to Jericho and to Ai
and they work
and sandals
And they go unto Joshua
and the men of Israel say unto the Hivite
and they say unto Joshua
And they say unto him
and all that He hath done to the two kings of the Amorite who `are' beyond the Jordan
`And our elders
this our bread -- hot we provided ourselves with it out of our houses
and these `are' the wine-bottles which we filled
And the men take of their provision
and Joshua maketh with them peace
And it cometh to pass
And the sons of Israel journey and come in unto their cities on the third day -- and their cities `are' Gibeon
and the sons of Israel have not smitten them
And all the princes say unto all the company
this we do to them
And the princes say unto them
And Joshua calleth for them
and now
And they answer Joshua and say
and now
And he doth to them so
and Joshua maketh them on that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the company
