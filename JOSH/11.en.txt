And it cometh to pass when Jabin king of Hazor heareth
and unto the kings who `are' on the north in the hill-country
`to' the Canaanite on the east
and they go out
and all these kings are met together
And Jehovah saith unto Joshua
And Joshua cometh
and Jehovah giveth them into the hand of Israel
and Joshua doth to them as Jehovah said to him; their horses he hath houghed
And Joshua turneth back at that time
and they smite every person who `is' in it by the mouth of the sword; he hath devoted -- he hath not left any one breathing
and all the cities of these kings
Only
and all the spoil of these cities
As Jehovah commanded Moses His servant
And Joshua taketh all this land: the hill-country
from the mount of Halak
Many days hath Joshua made with all these kings war;"
there hath not been a city which made peace with the sons of Israel save the Hivite
for from Jehovah it hath been to strengthen their heart
And Joshua cometh at that time
There hath not been left Anakim in the land of the sons of Israel; only in Gaza
And Joshua taketh the whole of the land
