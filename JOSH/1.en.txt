And it cometh to pass after the death of Moses
`Moses my servant is dead
`Every place on which the sole of your foot treadeth
From this wilderness and Lebanon
`No man doth station himself before thee all days of thy life; as I have been with Moses
be strong and courageous
`Only
the book of this law doth not depart out of thy mouth
`Have not I commanded thee? be strong and courageous; be not terrified nor affrighted
And Joshua commandeth the authorities of the people
`Pass over into the midst of the camp
And to the Reubenite
`Remember the word which Moses
your wives
till that Jehovah giveth rest to your brethren as to yourselves
And they answer Joshua
according to all that we hearkened unto Moses `in'
Any man who doth provoke thy mouth
