And it cometh to pass
that they are greatly afraid
And Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sendeth unto Hoham king of Hebron
`Come up unto me
And five kings of the Amorite (the king of Jerusalem
And the men of Gibeon send unto Joshua
And Joshua goeth up from Gilgal
And Jehovah saith unto Joshua
And Joshua cometh in unto them suddenly (all the night he hath gone up from Gilgal)
and Jehovah doth crush them before Israel
And it cometh to pass
Then speaketh Joshua to Jehovah in the day of Jehovah's giving up the Amorites before the sons of Israel
and the sun standeth still
And there hath not been like that day before it or after it
And Joshua turneth back
And these five kings flee
and it is declared to Joshua
And Joshua saith
and ye
And it cometh to pass
that all the people turn back to the camp
And Joshua saith
and they do so
And it cometh to pass
And Joshua saith unto them
and Joshua smiteth them afterwards
And it cometh to pass
And Makkedah hath Joshua captured on that day
And Joshua passeth over
and Jehovah giveth also it into the hand of Israel
And Joshua passeth over
And Jehovah giveth Lachish into the hand of Israel
Than hath Horam king of Gezer come up to help Lachish
And Joshua passeth over
and capture it on that day
And Joshua goeth up
and capture it
And Joshua turneth back
and captureth it
And Joshua smiteth all the land of the hill-country
And Joshua smiteth them from Kadesh-Barnea
and all these kings and their land hath Joshua captured `at' one time
and Joshua turneth back
