And these `are' they `of' the sons of Israel who inherited in the land of Canaan
by lot `is' their inheritance
for Moses hath given the inheritance of two of the tribes
for the sons of Joseph hath been two tribes
as Jehovah commanded Moses
And the sons of Judah come nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal
a son of forty years `am' I in Moses
and my brethren who have gone up with me have caused the heart of the people to melt
and Moses sweareth in that day
`And
yet `am' I to-day strong as in the day of Moses' sending me; as my power then
`And now
And Joshua blesseth him
therefore hath Hebron been to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenezzite for an inheritance unto this day
and the name of Hebron formerly `is' Kirjath-Arba (he `is' the great man among the Anakim); and the land hath rest from war."
