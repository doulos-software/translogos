And Joshua riseth early in the morning
And it cometh to pass
and command the people
only
And Joshua saith unto the people
And Joshua speaketh unto the priests
And Jehovah saith unto Joshua
and thou
And Joshua saith unto the sons of Israel
and Joshua saith
lo
and now
and it hath been
And it cometh to pass
and at those bearing the ark coming in unto the Jordan
that the waters stand; those coming down from above have risen -- one heap
and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stand on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan -- established
