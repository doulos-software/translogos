And all the company of the sons of Israel are assembled `at' Shiloh
And there are left among the sons of Israel who have not shared their inheritance
and Joshua saith unto the sons of Israel
Give for you three men for a tribe
and they have divided it into seven portions -- Judah doth stay by its border on the south
and ye describe the land `in' seven portions
for there is no portion to the Levites in your midst
And the men rise and go; and Joshua commandeth those who are going to describe the land
And the men go
And Joshua casteth for them a lot in Shiloh before Jehovah
And a lot goeth up `for' the tribe of the sons of Benjamin
And the border is to them at the north side from the Jordan
and the border hath gone over thence to Luz
and the border hath been marked out
And the south quarter `is' from the end of Kirjath-Jearim
and the border hath come down unto the extremity of the hill which `is' on the front of the valley of the son of Hinnom
and hath been marked out on the north
and passed over unto the side over-against Arabah northward
and the border hath passed over unto the side of Beth-Hoglah northward
and the Jordan doth border it at the east quarter; this `is' the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin
And the cities for the tribe of the sons of Benjamin
and Beth-Arabah
and Avim
and Chephar-Haammonai
Gibeon
and Mizpeh
and Rekem
and Zelah
