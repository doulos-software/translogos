Then Joshua calleth for the Reubenite
and saith unto them
ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day
`And
Only
And Joshua blesseth them
And to the half of the tribe of Manasseh hath Moses given
and speak unto them
And the sons of Reuben
and they come in unto the districts of the Jordan
And the sons of Israel hear
And the sons of Israel hear
and the sons of Israel send unto the sons of Reuben
and ten princes with him
And they come in unto the sons of Reuben
`Thus said all the company of Jehovah
Is the iniquity of Peor little to us
that ye turn back to-day from after Jehovah? and it hath been -- ye rebel to-day against Jehovah -- and to-morrow against all the company of Israel He is wroth."
`And surely
Did not Achan son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing
And the sons of Reuben
`The God of gods -- Jehovah
`we are' building for ourselves an altar to turn back from after Jehovah
`And if not
for a border hath Jehovah put between us and you
`And we say
but a witness it `is' between us and you
`And we say
`Far be it from us to rebel against Jehovah
And Phinehas the priest
And Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest saith unto the sons of Reuben
And Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest
and the thing is good in the eyes of the sons of Israel
And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad proclaim concerning the altar
