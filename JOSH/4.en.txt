And it cometh to pass
`Take for you out of the people twelve men
and command ye them
And Joshua calleth unto the twelve men whom he prepared out of the sons of Israel
and Joshua saith to them
so that this is a sign in your midst
that ye have said to them
And the sons of Israel do so as Joshua commanded
even the twelve stones hath Joshua raised up out of the midst of the Jordan
And the priests bearing the ark are standing in the midst of the Jordan till the completion of the whole thing which Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak unto the people
And it cometh to pass when all the people have completed to pass over
and the sons of Reuben
about forty thousand
On that day hath Jehovah made Joshua great in the eyes of all Israel
And Jehovah speaketh unto Joshua
`Command the priests bearing the ark of the testimony
And Joshua commandeth the priests
And it cometh to pass
And the people have come up out of the Jordan on the tenth of the first month
and these twelve stones
And he speaketh unto the sons of Israel
then ye have caused your sons to know
because Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan at your presence
so that all the people of the land do know the hand of Jehovah that it `is' strong
