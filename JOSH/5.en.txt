And it cometh to pass when all the kings of the Amorite which `are' beyond the Jordan
At that time said Jehovah unto Joshua
and Joshua maketh for him knives of flint
And this `is' the thing `for' which Joshua circumciseth `them': all the people who are coming out of Egypt
for all the people who are coming out were circumcised
for forty years have the sons of Israel gone in the wilderness
and their sons He raised up in their stead
And it cometh to pass when all the nation have completed to be circumcised
and Jehovah saith unto Joshua
And the sons of Israel encamp in Gilgal
and they eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow of the passover
and the manna doth cease on the morrow in their eating of the old corn of the land
And it cometh to pass in Joshua's being by Jericho
And He saith
And the Prince of Jehovah's host saith unto Joshua
