And the sons of Israel commit a trespass in the devoted thing
And Joshua sendeth men from Jericho to Ai
and they turn back unto Joshua
And there go up of the people thither about three thousand men
and the men of Ai smite of them about thirty and six men
And Joshua rendeth his garments
And Joshua saith
Oh
and the Canaanite and all the inhabitants of the land do hear
And Jehovah saith unto Joshua
Israel hath sinned
and the sons of Israel have not been able to stand before their enemies; the neck they turn before their enemies
`Rise
and ye have been brought near in the morning by your tribes
and it hath been
And Joshua riseth early in the morning
and he bringeth near the family of Judah
and he bringeth near his household by men
And Joshua saith unto Achan
And Achan answereth Joshua
and I see among the spoil a goodly robe of Shinar
And Joshua sendeth messengers
and they take them out of the midst of the tent
And Joshua taketh Achan son of Zerah
And Joshua saith
and they raise up over him a great heap of stones unto this day
