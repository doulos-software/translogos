And the lot for the sons of Joseph goeth out from Jordan `by' Jericho
and hath gone out from Beth-El to Luz
and gone down westward unto the border of Japhleti
And the sons of Joseph -- Manasseh and Ephraim -- inherit."
And the border of the sons of Ephraim is by their families; and the border of their inheritance is on the east
and the border hath gone out at the sea
and gone down from Janohah `to' Ataroth
From Tappuah the border goeth westward unto the brook of Kanah
And the separate cities of the sons of Ephraim `are' in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh
and they have not dispossessed the Canaanite who is dwelling in Gezer
