And Joshua son of Nun sendeth from Shittim
And it is told to the king of Jericho
And the king of Jericho sendeth unto Rahab
And the woman taketh the two men
and it cometh to pass -- the gate is to `be' shut -- in the dark
and she hath caused them to go up on the roof
And the men have pursued after them the way of the Jordan
And -- before they lie down -- she hath gone up unto them on the roof
and she saith unto the men
`For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red Sea at your presence
And we hear
`And now
and have kept alive my father
And the men say to her
And she causeth them to go down by a rope through the window
and she saith to them
And the men say unto her
lo
and it hath been
and if thou declare this our matter
And she saith
And they go
And the two men turn back
and they say unto Joshua
