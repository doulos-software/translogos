(And Jericho shutteth itself up
And Jehovah saith unto Joshua
and ye have compassed the city -- all the men of battle -- going round the city once; thus thou dost six days;"
and seven priests do bear seven trumpets of the jubilee before the ark
and it hath been
And Joshua son of Nun calleth unto the priests
and He said unto the people
And it cometh to pass
and he who is armed is going before the priests blowing the trumpets
and the people hath Joshua commanded
And the ark of Jehovah doth compass the city
And Joshua riseth early in the morning
and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of the jubilee before the ark of Jehovah are walking
And they compass the city on the second day once
And it cometh to pass
and it cometh to pass
and the city hath been devoted
and surely ye have kept from the devoted thing
and all the silver and gold
And the people shout
and they devote all that `is' in the city
And to the two men who are spying the land Joshua said
And the young man
And the city they have burnt with fire
and Rahab the harlot
And Joshua adjureth `them' at that time
and Jehovah is with Joshua
