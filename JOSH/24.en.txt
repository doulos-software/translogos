And Joshua gathereth all the tribes of Israel to Shechem
And Joshua saith unto all the people
and I take your father Abraham from beyond the River
And I give to Isaac
And I send Moses and Aaron
And I bring out your fathers from Egypt
and they cry unto Jehovah
`And I bring you in unto the land of the Amorite who is dwelling beyond the Jordan
`And Balak son of Zippor
and I have not been willing to hearken to Balaam
`And ye pass over the Jordan
And I send before you the hornet
`And I give to you a land for which thou hast not laboured
`And now
and if wrong in your eyes to serve Jehovah -- choose for you to-day whom ye do serve; -- whether the gods whom your fathers served
And the people answer and say
for Jehovah our God `is' He who is bringing us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt
and Jehovah casteth out the whole of the peoples
And Joshua saith unto the people
When ye forsake Jehovah
And the people saith unto Joshua
And Joshua saith unto the people
and
And the people say unto Joshua
And Joshua maketh a covenant with the people on that day
And Joshua writeth these words in the Book of the Law of God
And Joshua saith unto all the people
And Joshua sendeth the people away
And it cometh to pass
and they bury him in the border of his inheritance
And Israel serveth Jehovah all the days of Joshua
And the bones of Joseph
And Eleazar son of Aaron died
