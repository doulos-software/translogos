And the heads of the fathers of the Levites draw nigh unto Eleazar the priest
and they speak unto them in Shiloh
And the sons of Israel give to the Levites
And the lot goeth out for the families of the Kohathite
and for the sons of Kohath who are left
And for the sons of Gershon `are'
For the sons of Merari
And the sons of Israel give to the Levites these cities and their suburbs
And they give out of the tribe of the sons of Judah
and they are for the sons of Aaron
and they give to them the city of Arba father of Anak (it `is' Hebron)
and the field of the city and its villages they have given to Caleb son of Jephunneh for his possession."
And to the sons of Aaron the priest they have given the city of refuge `for' the man-slayer
and Jattir and its suburbs
and Holon and its suburbs
and Ain and its suburbs
And out of the tribe of Benjamin
Anathoth and its suburbs
all the cities of the sons of Aaron the priests
And for the families of the sons of Kohath
and they give to them the city of refuge `for' the man-slayer
and Kibzaim and its suburbs
And out of the tribe of Dan
Aijalon and its suburbs
And out of the half of the tribe of Manasseh
all the cities `are' ten and their suburbs
And for the sons of Gershon
And out of the tribe of Issachar
Jarmuth and its suburbs
And out of the tribe of Asher
Helkath and its suburbs
And out of the tribe of Naphtali
all the cities of the Gershonite
And for the families of the sons of Merari
Dimnah and its suburbs
And out of the tribe of Reuben
Kedemoth and its suburbs
And out of the tribe of Gad
Heshbon and its suburbs
All the cities for the sons of Merari
All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the sons of Israel `are' forty and eight cities
These cities are each city and its suburbs round about it; so to all these cities."
And Jehovah giveth to Israel the whole of the land which He hath sworn to give to their fathers
and Jehovah giveth rest to them round about
there hath not fallen a thing of all the good thing which Jehovah spake unto the house of Israel -- the whole hath come."
