And the lot is for the tribe of Manasseh (for he `is' first-born of Joseph)
And there is for the sons of Manasseh who are left
As to Zelophehad
and they draw near before Eleazar the priest
And ten portions fall `to' Manasseh
for the daughters of Manasseh have inherited an inheritance in the midst of his sons
And the border of Manasseh is from Asher to Michmethah
To Manasseh hath been the land of Tappuah
And the border hath come down `to' the brook of Kanah
Southward `is' to Ephraim and northward to Manasseh
And Manasseh hath in Issachar and in Asher
And the sons of Manasseh have not been able to occupy these cities
and it cometh to pass when the sons of Israel have been strong
And the sons of Joseph speak with Joshua
And Joshua saith unto them
And the sons of Joseph say
And Joshua speaketh unto the house of Joseph
because the mountain is thine; because it `is' a forest -- thou hast prepared it
