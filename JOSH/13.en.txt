And Joshua is old
`This `is' the land that is left; all the circuits of the Philistines
from Sihor which `is' on the front of Egypt
`From the south
and the land of the Giblite
all the inhabitants of the hill-country
`And now
with it the Reubenite
from Aroer
and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorite
and Gilead
all the kingdom of Og in Bashan
and the sons of Israel dispossessed not the Geshurite
Only
And Moses giveth to the tribe of the sons of Reuben
and the border is to them from Aroer
Heshbon
and Jahazah
and Kirjathaim
and Beth-Peor
and all the cities of the plain
And Balaam
And the border of the sons of Reuben is the Jordan
And Moses giveth to the tribe of Gad
and the border is to them Jazer
and from Heshbon unto Ramath-Mispeh
and in the valley
This `is' the inheritance of the sons of Gad
And Moses giveth to the half of the tribe of Manasseh; and it is to the half of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh
And their border is from Mahanaim
and the half of Gilead
These `are' they whom Moses caused to inherit in the plains of Moab
and to the tribe of Levi Moses gave not an inheritance; Jehovah
