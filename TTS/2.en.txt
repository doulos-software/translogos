And thou -- be speaking what doth become the sound teaching;"
aged men to be temperate
aged women
that they may make the young women sober-minded
sober
The younger men
concerning all things thyself showing a pattern of good works; in the teaching uncorruptedness
discourse sound
Servants -- to their own masters `are' to be subject
not purloining
For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men
teaching us
waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ
who did give himself for us
these things be speaking
