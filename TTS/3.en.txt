Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities
of no one to speak evil
for we were once -- also we -- thoughtless
and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour did appear"
(not by works that `are' in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness
which He poured upon us richly
that having been declared righteous by His grace
Stedfast `is' the word; and concerning these things I counsel thee to affirm fully
and foolish questions
A sectarian man
having known that he hath been subverted who `is' such
When I shall send Artemas unto thee
Zenas the lawyer and Apollos bring diligently on their way
and let them learn -- ours also -- to be leading in good works to the necessary uses
Salute thee do all those with me; salute those loving us in faith; the grace `is' with you all!"
