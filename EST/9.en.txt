And in the twelfth month -- it `is' the month of Adar -- on the thirteenth day of it
the Jews have been assembled in their cities
And all heads of the provinces
for great `is' Mordecai in the house of the king
And the Jews smite among all their enemies -- a smiting of the sword
and in Shushan the palace have the Jews slain and destroyed five hundred men;"
and Parshandatha
and Poratha
and Parmashta
ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha
On that day hath come the number of the slain in Shushan the palace before the king
and the king saith to Esther the queen
And Esther saith
And the king saith -- `to be done so;' and a law is given in Shushan
And the Jews who `are' in Shushan are assembled also on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar
And the rest of the Jews
on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar
And the Jews who `are' in Shushan have been assembled
Therefore the Jews of the villages
And Mordecai writeth these things
to establish on them
as days on which the Jews have rested from their enemies
And the Jews have received that which they had begun to do
because Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite
and in her coming in before the king
therefore they have called these days Purim -- by the name of the lot -- therefore
the Jews have established and received upon them
and these days are remembered and kept in every generation and generation
And Esther the queen
and he sendeth letters unto all the Jews
to establish these days of Purim
And a saying of Esther hath established these matters of Purim
