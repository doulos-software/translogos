After these things hath the king Ahasuerus exalted Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite
and all servants of the king
And the servants of the king
And it cometh to pass
And Haman seeth that Mordecai is not bowing and doing obeisance to him
and it is contemptible in his eyes to put forth a hand on Mordecai by himself
In the first month -- it `is' the month of Nisan -- in the twelfth year of the king Ahasuerus
And Haman saith to the king Ahasuerus
if to the king `it be' good
And the king turneth aside his signet from off his hand
and the king saith to Haman
And scribes of the king are called
and letters to be sent by the hand of the runners unto all provinces of the king
a copy of the writing to be made law in every province and province is revealed to all the peoples
The runners have gone forth
