On that day hath the king Ahasuerus given to Esther the queen the house of Haman
and the king turneth aside his signet
And Esther addeth
and the king holdeth out to Esther the golden sceptre
and saith
for how do I endure when I have looked on the evil that doth find my people? and how do I endure when I have looked on the destruction of my kindred?'"
And the king Ahasuerus saith to Esther the queen
and ye
And the scribes of the king are called
And he writeth in the name of the king Ahasuerus
that the king hath given to the Jews who `are' in every city and city
In one day
a copy of the writing to be made law in every province and province is revealed to all the peoples
The runners
And Mordecai went out from before the king
to the Jews hath been light
and in every province and province
