And it cometh to pass on the third day
and it cometh to pass
And the king saith to her
And Esther saith
and the king saith
And the king saith to Esther
And Esther answereth and saith
if I have found grace in the eyes of the king
And Haman goeth forth on that day rejoicing and glad in heart
And Haman forceth himself
and Haman recounteth to them the glory of his wealth
And Haman saith
and all this is not profitable to me
And Zeresh his wife saith to him
