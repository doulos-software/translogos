And Mordecai hath known all that hath been done
and he cometh in unto the front of the gate of the king
And in every province and province
And young women of Esther come in and her eunuchs
And Esther calleth to Hatach
And Hatach goeth out unto Mordecai
and Mordecai declareth to him all that hath met him
and the copy of the writing of the law that had been given in Shushan to destroy them he hath given to him
And Hatach cometh in and declareth to Esther the words of Mordecai
and Esther speaketh to Hatach
`All servants of the king
And they declare to Mordecai the words of Esther
and Mordecai speaketh to send back unto Esther: `Do not think in thy soul to be delivered `in' the house of the king
but if thou keep entirely silent at this time
And Esther speaketh to send back unto Mordecai:"
`Go
And Mordecai passeth on
