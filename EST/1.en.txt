And it cometh to pass
in those days
in the third year of his reign
in his shewing the wealth of the honour of his kingdom
And at the fulness of these days hath the king made to all the people who are found in Shushan the palace
white linen
and the giving of drink in vessels of gold
And the drinking `is' according to law
Also Vashti the queen hath made a banquet for women
On the seventh day
to bring in Vashti the queen before the king
and the queen Vashti refuseth to come in at the word of the king that `is' by the hand of the eunuchs
And the king saith to wise men
and he who is near unto him `is' Carshena
`According to law
And Memucan saith before the king and the heads
for go forth doth the word of the queen unto all the women
yea
`If to the king `it be' good
and the sentence of the king that he maketh hath been heard in all his kingdom -- for it `is' great -- and all the wives give honour to their husbands
And the thing is good in the eyes of the king
and sendeth letters unto all provinces of the king
