After these things
and servants of the king
and the king doth appoint inspectors in all provinces of his kingdom
and the young woman who is good in the eyes of the king doth reign instead of Vashti;' and the thing is good in the eyes of the king
A man
who had been removed from Jerusalem with the removal that was removed with Jeconiah king of Judah
and he is supporting Hadassah -- she `is' Esther -- daughter of his uncle
And it cometh to pass
and the young woman is good in his eyes
Esther hath not declared her people
and during every day Mordecai is walking up and down before the court of the house of the women to know the welfare of Esther
And in the drawing nigh of the turn of each young woman to come in unto the king Ahasuerus
and with this the young woman hath come in unto the king
in the evening she hath gone in
And in the drawing nigh of the turn of Esther -- daughter of Abihail
And Esther is taken unto the king Ahasuerus
and the king loveth Esther above all the women
and the king maketh a great banquet to all his heads and his servants -- the banquet of Esther -- and a release to the provinces hath made
And in the virgins being gathered a second time
Esther is not declaring her kindred and her people
In those days
and the thing is known to Mordecai
and the thing is sought out
