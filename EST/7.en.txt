And the king cometh in
and the king saith to Esther also on the second day
And Esther the queen answereth and saith
for we have been sold
And the king Ahasuerus saith
And Esther saith
And the king hath risen
And the king hath turned back out of the garden of the house unto the house of the banquet of wine
And Harbonah
And they hang Haman upon the tree that he had prepared for Mordecai
