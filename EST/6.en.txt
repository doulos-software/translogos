On that night hath the sleep of the king fled away
and it is found written that Mordecai had declared concerning Bigthana and Teresh
And the king saith
And the king saith
and the servants of the king say unto him
And Haman cometh in
And Haman saith unto the king
let them bring in royal clothing that the king hath put on himself
and to give the clothing and the horse into the hand of a man of the heads of the king
And the king saith to Haman
And Haman taketh the clothing
And Mordecai turneth back unto the gate of the king
and Haman recounteth to Zeresh his wife
They are yet speaking with him
