O thoughtless Galatians
this only do I wish to learn from you -- by works of law the Spirit did ye receive
so thoughtless are ye! having begun in the Spirit
so many things did ye suffer in vain! if
He
according as Abraham did believe God
know ye
and the Writing having foreseen that by faith God doth declare righteous the nations did proclaim before the good news to Abraham --"
`Blessed in thee shall be all the nations;' so that those of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham
for as many as are of works of law are under a curse
and that in law no one is declared righteous with God
and the law is not by faith
Christ did redeem us from the curse of the law
that to the nations the blessing of Abraham may come in Christ Jesus
Brethren
and to Abraham were the promises spoken
and this I say
for if by law `be' the inheritance
Why
and the mediator is not of one
the law
but the Writing did shut up the whole under sin
And before the coming of the faith
so that the law became our child-conductor -- to Christ
and the faith having come
for ye are all sons of God through the faith in Christ Jesus
for as many as to Christ were baptized did put on Christ;"
there is not here Jew or Greek
and if ye `are' of Christ then of Abraham ye are seed
