Paul
and all the brethren with me
Grace to you
who did give himself for our sins
to whom `is' the glory to the ages of the ages. Amen."
I wonder that ye are so quickly removed from Him who did call you in the grace of Christ to another good news;"
that is not another
but even if we or a messenger out of heaven may proclaim good news to you different from what we did proclaim to you -- anathema let him be!"
as we have said before
for now men do I persuade
And I make known to you
for neither did I from man receive it
for ye did hear of my behaviour once in Judaism
and I was advancing in Judaism above many equals in age in mine own race
and when God was well pleased -- having separated me from the womb of my mother
to reveal His Son in me
nor did I go up to Jerusalem unto those who were apostles before me
then
and other of the apostles I did not see
And the things that I write to you
then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia
and was unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea
and only they were hearing
and they were glorifying God in me."
