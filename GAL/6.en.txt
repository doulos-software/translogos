Brethren
of one another the burdens bear ye
for if any one doth think `himself' to be something -- being nothing -- himself he doth deceive;"
and his own work let each one prove
for each one his own burden shall bear."
And let him who is instructed in the word share with him who is instructing -- in all good things."
Be not led astray; God is not mocked; for what a man may sow -- that also he shall reap
because he who is sowing to his own flesh
and in the doing good we may not be faint-hearted
therefore
Ye see in how large letters I have written to you with my own hand;"
as many as are willing to make a good appearance in the flesh
for neither do those circumcised themselves keep the law
And for me
for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything
and as many as by this rule do walk -- peace upon them
Henceforth
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ `is' with your spirit
