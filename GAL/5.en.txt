In the freedom
lo
and I testify again to every man circumcised
ye were freed from the Christ
for we by the Spirit
for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything
Ye were running well; who did hinder you -- not to obey the truth?"
the obedience `is' not of him who is calling you!"
a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven;"
I have confidence in regard to you in the Lord
And I
O that even they would cut themselves off who are unsettling you!"
For ye -- to freedom ye were called
for all the law in one word is fulfilled -- in this: `Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;'"
and if one another ye do bite and devour
And I say: In the Spirit walk ye
for the flesh doth desire contrary to the Spirit
and if by the Spirit ye are led
And manifest also are the works of the flesh
idolatry
envyings
And the fruit of the Spirit is: Love
meekness
and those who are Christ's
if we may live in the Spirit
let us not become vain-glorious -- one another provoking
