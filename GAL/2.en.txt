Then
and I went up by revelation
but not even Titus
and `that' because of the false brethren brought in unawares
to whom not even for an hour we gave place by subjection
And from those who were esteemed to be something -- whatever they were then
but
for He who did work with Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision
and having known the grace that was given to me
only
And when Peter came to Antioch
for before the coming of certain from James
and dissemble with him also did the other Jews
But when I saw that they are not walking uprightly to the truth of the good news
we by nature Jews
having known also that a man is not declared righteous by works of law
And if
for if the things I threw down
for I through law
with Christ I have been crucified
I do not make void the grace of God
