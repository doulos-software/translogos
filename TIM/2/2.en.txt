Thou
and the things that thou didst hear from me through many witnesses
thou
no one serving as a soldier did entangle himself with the affairs of life
and if also any one may strive
the labouring husbandman it behoveth first of the fruits to partake;"
be considering what things I say
Remember Jesus Christ
in which I suffer evil -- unto bonds
because of this all things do I endure
Stedfast `is' the word: For if we died together -- we also shall live together;"
if we do endure together -- we shall also reign together; if we deny `him'
if we are not stedfast
These things remind `them' of
be diligent to present thyself approved to God -- a workman irreproachable
and the profane vain talkings stand aloof from
and their word as a gangrene will have pasture
who concerning the truth did swerve
sure
And in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver
if
and the youthful lusts flee thou
and the foolish and uninstructed questions be avoiding
and a servant of the Lord it behoveth not to strive
in meekness instructing those opposing -- if perhaps God may give to them repentance to an acknowledging of the truth
and they may awake out of the devil's snare
