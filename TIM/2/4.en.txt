I do fully testify
preach the word; be earnest in season
for there shall be a season when the sound teaching they will not suffer
and indeed
And thou -- watch in all things; suffer evil; do the work of one proclaiming good news; of thy ministration make full assurance
for I am already being poured out
the good strife I have striven
henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of the righteousness that the Lord -- the Righteous Judge -- shall give to me in that day
Be diligent to come unto me quickly
for Demas forsook me
Lukas only is with me; Markus having taken
and Tychicus I sent to Ephesus;"
the cloak that I left in Troas with Carpus
Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil; may the Lord repay to him according to his works
of whom also do thou beware
in my first defence no one stood with me
and the Lord stood by me
and the Lord shall free me from every evil work
Salute Prisca and Aquilas
Erastus did remain in Corinth
be diligent to come before winter. Salute thee doth Eubulus
The Lord Jesus Christ `is' with thy spirit; the grace `is' with you! Amen."
