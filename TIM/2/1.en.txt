Paul
to Timotheus
I am thankful to God
desiring greatly to see thee
taking remembrance of the unfeigned faith that is in thee
For which cause I remind thee to stir up the gift of God that is in thee through the putting on of my hands
for God did not give us a spirit of fear
therefore thou mayest not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord
who did save us
and was made manifest now through the manifestation of our Saviour Jesus Christ
to which I was placed a preacher and an apostle
for which cause also these things I suffer
The pattern hold thou of sound words
the good thing committed guard thou through the Holy Spirit that is dwelling in us;"
thou hast known this
may the Lord give kindness to the house of Onesiphorus
but being in Rome
may the Lord give to him to find kindness from the Lord in that day; and how many things in Ephesus he did minister thou dost very well know."
