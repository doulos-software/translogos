And this know thou
for men shall be lovers of themselves
without natural affection
traitors
having a form of piety
for of these there are those coming into the houses and leading captive the silly women
always learning
and
but they shall not advance any further
And thou -- thou hast followed after my teaching
the persecutions
and all also who will to live piously in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted
and evil men and impostors shall advance to the worse
And thou -- be remaining in the things which thou didst learn and wast entrusted with
and because from a babe the Holy Writings thou hast known
every Writing `is' God-breathed
that the man of God may be fitted -- for every good work having been completed."
