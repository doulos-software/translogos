An aged person thou mayest not rebuke
aged women as mothers
honour widows who are really widows;"
and if any widow have children or grandchildren
And she who is really a widow and desolate
and she who is given to luxury
and these things charge
and if any one for his own -- and especially for those of the household -- doth not provide
A widow -- let her not be enrolled under sixty years of age
in good works being testified to: if she brought up children
and younger widows be refusing
having judgment
and at the same time also
I wish
for already certain did turn aside after the Adversary."
If any believing man or believing woman have widows
The well-leading elders of double honour let them be counted worthy
for the Writing saith
Against an elder an accusation receive not
Those sinning
I testify fully
Be laying hands quickly on no one
no longer be drinking water
of certain men the sins are manifest beforehand
in like manner also the right works are manifest beforehand
