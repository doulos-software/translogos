As many as are servants under a yoke
and those having believing masters
if any one be teaching otherwise
he is proud
wranglings of men wholly corrupted in mind
but it is great gain -- the piety with contentment;"
for nothing did we bring into the world -- `it is' manifest that we are able to carry nothing out;"
but having food and raiment -- with these we shall suffice ourselves;"
and those wishing to be rich
for a root of all the evils is the love of money
and thou
be striving the good strife of the faith
I charge thee
that thou keep the command unspotted
which in His own times He shall shew -- the blessed and only potentate
who only is having immortality
Those rich in the present age charge thou not to be high-minded
to do good
treasuring up to themselves a right foundation for the time to come
O Timotheus
which certain professing -- concerning the faith did swerve; the grace `is' with you. Amen."
