And the Spirit expressly speaketh
in hypocrisy speaking lies
forbidding to marry -- to abstain from meats that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those believing and acknowledging the truth
because every creature of God `is' good
for it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession."
These things placing before the brethren
and the profane and old women's fables reject thou
for the bodily exercise is unto little profit
stedfast `is' the word
for for this we both labour and are reproached
Charge these things
let no one despise thy youth
till I come
be not careless of the gift in thee
of these things be careful; in these things be
take heed to thyself
