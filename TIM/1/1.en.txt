Paul
to Timotheus -- genuine child in faith: Grace
according as I did exhort thee to remain in Ephesus -- I going on to Macedonia -- that thou mightest charge certain not to teach any other thing
nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies
And the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart
from which certain
willing to be teachers of law
and we have known that the law `is' good
having known this
whoremongers
according to the good news of the glory of the blessed God
And I give thanks to him who enabled me -- Christ Jesus our Lord -- that he did reckon me stedfast
who before was speaking evil
and exceedingly abound did the grace of our Lord
stedfast `is' the word
but because of this I found kindness
and to the King of the ages
This charge I commit to thee
having faith and a good conscience
of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander
