I exhort
for kings
for this `is' right and acceptable before God our Saviour
who doth will all men to be saved
for one `is' God
who did give himself a ransom for all -- the testimony in its own times --"
in regard to which I was set a preacher and apostle -- truth I say in Christ
I wish
in like manner also the women
but -- which becometh women professing godly piety -- through good works."
Let a woman in quietness learn in all subjection
and a woman I do not suffer to teach
for Adam was first formed
and Adam was not deceived
and she shall be saved through the child-bearing
