Because Israel `is' a youth
They have called to them rightly
And I have caused Ephraim to go on foot
With cords of man I do draw them
He turneth not back unto the land of Egypt
Grievous hath been the sword in his cities
And My people are hanging in suspense
How do I give thee up
I do not the fierceness of My anger
After Jehovah they go -- as a lion He roareth
They tremble as a sparrow out of Egypt
Compassed Me with feigning hath Ephraim
