Ephraim is enjoying wind
And a controversy hath Jehovah with Judah
In the womb he took his brother by the heel
Yea
Even Jehovah
And thou
Canaan! in his hand `are' balances of deceit! To oppress he hath loved."
And Ephraim saith: `Surely I have become rich
And I -- Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt
And I have spoken unto the prophets
Surely Gilead `is' iniquity
And Jacob doth flee to the country of Aram
And by a prophet hath Jehovah brought up Israel out of Egypt
Ephraim hath provoked most bitterly
