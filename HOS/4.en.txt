`Hear a word of Jehovah
Swearing
Therefore mourn doth the land
Only
And thou hast stumbled in the day
Cut off have been My people for lack of knowledge
According to their abundance so they sinned against Me
The sin of My people they do eat
And it hath been
And they have eaten
Whoredom
My people at its staff asketh and its rod declareth to it
On tops of the mountains they do sacrifice
Therefore commit whoredom do your daughters
Though a harlot thou `art'
For as a refractory heifer hath Israel turned aside
Joined to idols `is' Ephraim
Sour `is' their drink
Distressed her hath wind with its wings
