`Say ye to your brethren -- Ammi
Plead ye with your mother -- plead
Lest I strip her naked. And have set her up as `in' the day of her birth
And her sons I do not pity
For gone a-whoring hath their mother
Therefore
And she hath pursued her lovers
And she knew not that I had given to her
Therefore do I turn back
And now do I reveal her dishonour before the eyes of her lovers
And I have caused to cease all her joy
And made desolate her vine and her fig-tree
And I have charged on her the days of the Baalim
Therefore
And given to her her vineyards from thence
And it hath come to pass
And I have turned aside the names of the lords from her mouth
And I have made to them a covenant in that day
And I have betrothed thee to Me to the age
And betrothed thee to Me in faithfulness
And it hath come to pass in that day
And the earth doth answer the corn
And I have sowed her to Me in the land
