`Rejoice not
Floor and wine-press do not delight them
They do not abide in the land of Jehovah
They pour not out wine to Jehovah
What do ye at the day appointed? And at the day of Jehovah's festival?"
For
Come in have the days of inspection
Ephraim is looking `away' from My God
They have gone deep -- have done corruptly
As grapes in a wilderness I found Israel
Ephraim `is' as a fowl
For though they nourish their sons
Ephraim! when I have looked to the rock
Give to them
All their evil `is' in Gilgal
Ephraim hath been smitten
Reject them doth my God
