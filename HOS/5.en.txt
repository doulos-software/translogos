`Hear this
And to slaughter sinners have gone deep
I have known Ephraim
They give not up their habitual doings
And humbled hath been the excellency of Israel to his face
With their flock and with their herd
Against Jehovah they dealt treacherously
Blow ye a cornet in Gibeah
Ephraim is for a desolation in a day of reproof
Princes of Judah have been as those removing a border
Oppressed is Ephraim
And I `am' as a moth to Ephraim
And see doth Ephraim his sickness
For I `am' as a lion to Ephraim
I go -- I turn back unto My place
