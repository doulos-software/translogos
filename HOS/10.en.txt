`An empty vine `is' Israel
Their heart hath been divided
For now they say: We have no king
They have spoken words
For the calves of Beth-Aven fear do inhabitants of Samaria
Also it to Asshur is carried
Cut off is Samaria! Its king `is' as a chip on the face of the waters."
And destroyed have been high places of Aven
From the days of Gibeah thou hast sinned
When I desire
And Ephraim `is' a trained heifer -- loving to thresh
Sow for yourselves in righteousness
Ye have ploughed wickedness
And rise doth a tumult among thy people
Thus hath Beth-El done to you
