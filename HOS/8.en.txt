`Unto thy mouth -- a trumpet
To Me they cry
Cast off good hath Israel
They have made kings
Cast off hath thy calf
For even it `is' of Israel; an artificer made it
For wind they sow
Israel hath been swallowed up
For they -- they have gone up `to' Asshur
Also though they hire among nations
Because Ephraim did multiply altars to sin
I write for him numerous things of My law
The sacrifices of Mine offerings! They sacrifice flesh
And forget doth Israel his Maker
