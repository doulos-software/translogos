When Ephraim speaketh tremblingly
And now do they add to sin
Therefore they are as a cloud of the morning
And I `am' Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt
I -- I have known thee in a wilderness
According to their feedings they are satiated
And I am to them as a lion
I do meet them as a bereaved bear
And I consume them there as a lioness
Thou hast destroyed thyself
I give to thee a king in Mine anger
Bound up `is' the iniquity of Ephraim
Pangs of a travailing woman come to him
From the hand of Sheol I do ransom them
Though he among brethren produceth fruit
Become desolate doth Samaria
