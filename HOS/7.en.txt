`When I give healing to Israel
And they do not say to their heart
With their wickedness they make glad a king
All of them `are' adulterers
A day of our king! Princes have polluted themselves `with' the poison of wine
For they have drawn near
All of them are warm as an oven
Ephraim! among peoples he mixeth himself
Devoured have strangers his power
And humbled hath been the excellency of Israel to his face
And Ephraim is as a simple dove without heart
When they go I spread over them My net
Wo to them
And have not cried unto Me with their heart
And I instructed -- I strengthened their arms
They turn back -- not to the Most High
