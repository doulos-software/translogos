A word of Jehovah that hath been unto Hosea
The commencement of Jehovah's speaking by Hosea. And Jehovah saith unto Hosea
And he goeth and taketh Gomer daughter of Diblaim
and Jehovah saith unto him
and it hath come to pass in that day that I have broken the bow of Israel
And she conceiveth again
and the house of Judah I pity
And she weaneth Lo-Ruhamah
and He saith
and the number of the sons of Israel hath been as the sand of the sea
and gathered have been the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel together
