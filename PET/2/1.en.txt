Simeon Peter
Grace to you
As all things to us His divine power (the things pertaining unto life and piety) hath given
through which to us the most great and precious promises have been given
And this same also -- all diligence having brought in besides
and in the knowledge the temperance
and in the piety the brotherly kindness
for these things being to you and abounding
for he with whom these things are not present is blind
wherefore
for so
Wherefore
and I think right
having known that soon is the laying aside of my tabernacle
and I will be diligent that also at every time ye have
For
for having received from God the Father honour and glory
and this voice we -- we did hear
And we have more firm the prophetic word
this first knowing
for not by will of man did ever prophecy come
