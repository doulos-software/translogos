And there did come also false prophets among the people
and many shall follow out their destructive ways
and in covetousness
For if God messengers who sinned did not spare
and the old world did not spare
and the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah having turned to ashes
and righteous Lot
for in seeing and hearing
The Lord hath known to rescue pious ones out of temptation
and chiefly those going behind the flesh in desire of uncleanness
whereas messengers
and these
about to receive a reward of unrighteousness
having eyes full of adultery
having forsaken a right way
and had a rebuke of his own iniquity -- a dumb ass
These are wells without water
for overswellings of vanity speaking
liberty to them promising
for
for it were better to them not to have acknowledged the way of the righteousness
and happened to them hath that of the true similitude; `A dog did turn back upon his own vomit
