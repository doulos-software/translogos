This
to be mindful of the sayings said before by the holy prophets
this first knowing
and saying
for this is unobserved by them willingly
through which the then world
and the present heavens and the earth
And this one thing let not be unobserved by you
the Lord is not slow in regard to the promise
and it will come -- the day of the Lord -- as a thief in the night
All these
waiting for and hasting to the presence of the day of God
and for new heavens and a new earth according to His promise we do wait
wherefore
and the long-suffering of our Lord count ye salvation
as also in all the epistles
Ye
and increase ye in grace
