Elders who `are' among you
feed the flock of God that `is' among you
neither as exercising lordship over the heritages
and at the manifestation of the chief Shepherd
In like manner
be humbled
all your care having cast upon Him
Be sober
whom resist
And the God of all grace
to Him `is' the glory
Through Silvanus
Salute you doth the `assembly' in Babylon jointly elected
Salute ye one another in a kiss of love; peace to you all who `are' in Christ Jesus! Amen."
