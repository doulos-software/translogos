Having put aside
as new-born babes the word's pure milk desire ye
if so be ye did taste that the Lord `is' gracious
to whom coming -- a living stone -- by men
and ye yourselves
Wherefore
to you
and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence -- who are stumbling at the word
and ye `are' a choice race
who `were' once not a people
Beloved
having your behaviour among the nations right
Be subject
whether to governors
because
as free
to all give ye honour; the brotherhood love ye; God fear ye; the king honour ye."
The domestics! be subjecting yourselves in all fear to the masters
for this `is' gracious
for what renown `is it'
for to this ye were called
who did not commit sin
who being reviled -- was not reviling again
who our sins himself did bear in his body
for ye were as sheep going astray
