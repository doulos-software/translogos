Peter
according to a foreknowledge of God the Father
Blessed `is' the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
to an inheritance incorruptible
who
in which ye are glad
that the proof of your faith -- much more precious than of gold that is perishing
whom
receiving the end of your faith -- salvation of souls;"
concerning which salvation seek out and search out did prophets who concerning the grace toward you did prophecy
searching in regard to what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ that was in them was manifesting
to whom it was revealed
Wherefore having girded up the loins of your mind
as obedient children
but according as He who did call you `is' holy
because it hath been written
and if on the Father ye do call
having known that
but with precious blood
foreknown
who through him do believe in God
Your souls having purified in the obedience of the truth through the Spirit to brotherly love unfeigned
being begotten again
because all flesh `is' as grass
and the saying of the Lord doth remain -- to the age; and this is the saying that was proclaimed good news to you."
