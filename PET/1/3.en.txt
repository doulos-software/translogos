In like manner
having beheld your pure behaviour in fear
whose adorning -- let it not be that which is outward
but -- the hidden man of the heart
for thus once also the holy women who did hope on God
as Sarah was obedient to Abraham
The husbands
And finally
not giving back evil for evil
for `he who is willing to love life
let him turn aside from evil
because the eyes of the Lord `are' upon the righteous
and who `is' he who will be doing you evil
but if ye also should suffer because of righteousness
and the Lord God sanctify in your hearts. And `be' ready always for defence to every one who is asking of you an account concerning the hope that `is' in you
having a good conscience
for `it is' better doing good
because also Christ once for sin did suffer -- righteous for unrighteous -- that he might lead us to God
in which also to the spirits in prison having gone he did preach
who sometime disbelieved
also to which an antitype doth now save us -- baptism
who is at the right hand of God
