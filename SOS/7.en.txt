As the chorus of `Mahanaim.' How beautiful were thy feet with sandals
Thy waist `is' a basin of roundness
Thy two breasts as two young ones
Thy neck as a tower of the ivory
Thy head upon thee as Carmel
How fair and how pleasant hast thou been
This thy stature hath been like to a palm
I said
And thy palate as the good wine --' Flowing to my beloved in uprightness
I `am' my beloved's
Come
We lodge in the villages
The mandrakes have given fragrance
