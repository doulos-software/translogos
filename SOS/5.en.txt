I have come in to my garden
I am sleeping
I have put off my coat
My beloved sent his hand from the net-work
I rose to open to my beloved
I opened to my beloved
The watchmen who go round about the city
I have adjured you
What `is' thy beloved above `any' beloved
My beloved `is' clear and ruddy
His head `is' pure gold -- fine gold
His eyes as doves by streams of water
His cheeks as a bed of the spice
His hands rings of gold
His limbs pillars of marble
His mouth is sweetness -- and all of him desirable
