The Song of Songs
Let him kiss me with kisses of his mouth
For fragrance `are' thy perfumes good. Perfume emptied out -- thy name
Draw me: after thee we run
Dark `am' I
Fear me not
Declare to me
If thou knowest not
To my joyous one in chariots of Pharaoh
Comely have been thy cheeks with garlands
Garlands of gold we do make for thee
While the king `is' in his circle
A bundle of myrrh `is' my beloved to me
A cluster of cypress `is' my beloved to me
Lo
Lo
The beams of our houses `are' cedars
