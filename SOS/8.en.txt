Who doth make thee as a brother to me
I lead thee
His left hand `is' under my head
I have adjured you
Who `is' this coming from the wilderness
Set me as a seal on thy heart
Many waters are not able to quench the love
We have a little sister
If she is a wall
I `am' a wall
Solomon hath a vineyard in Baal-Hamon
My vineyard -- my own -- is before me
The companions are attending to thy voice
Or to a young one of the harts on mountains of spices!"
