As a lily among the thorns
So `is' my friend among the daughters!"
As a citron among trees of the forest
He hath brought me in unto a house of wine
Sustain me with grape-cakes
His left hand `is' under my head
I have adjured you
The voice of my beloved! lo
My beloved `is' like to a roe
My beloved hath answered and said to me
For lo
The flowers have appeared in the earth
The fig-tree hath ripened her green figs
My dove
Seize ye for us foxes
My beloved `is' mine
Till the day doth break forth
