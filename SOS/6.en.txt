Whither hath thy beloved gone
My beloved went down to his garden
I `am' my beloved's
Fair `art' thou
Turn round thine eyes from before me
Thy teeth as a row of the lambs
As the work of the pomegranate `is' thy temple behind thy veil."
Sixty are queens
One is my dove
`Who `is' this that is looking forth as morning
Unto a garden of nuts I went down
I knew not my soul
Return
