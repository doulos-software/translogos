Lo
Thy teeth as a row of the shorn ones That have come up from the washing
As a thread of scarlet `are' thy lips
As the tower of David `is' thy neck
Thy two breasts `are' as two fawns
Till the day doth break forth
Thou `art' all fair
Come from Lebanon
Thou hast emboldened me
How wonderful have been thy loves
Thy lips drop honey
A garden shut up `is' my sister-spouse
Thy shoots a paradise of pomegranates
Cypresses with nard -- nard and saffron
A fount of gardens
Awake
