Wo `to' the city of blood
The sound of a whip
And the flame of a sword
Because of the abundance of the fornications of an harlot
Lo
And I have cast upon thee abominations
And it hath come to pass
Art thou better than No-Ammon
Cush her might
Even she doth become an exile
Even thou art drunken
All thy fortresses `are' fig-trees with first-fruits
Lo
Waters of a siege draw for thyself
There consume thee doth a fire
Multiply thy merchants above the stars of the heavens
Thy crowned ones `are' as a locust
Slumbered have thy friends
There is no weakening of thy destruction
