Come up hath a scatterer to thy face
For turned back hath Jehovah to the excellency of Jacob
The shield of his mighty ones is become red
In out-places shine do the chariots
He doth remember his honourable ones
Gates of the rivers have been opened
And it is established -- she hath removed
And Nineveh `is' as a pool of waters
Seize ye silver
She is empty
Where `is' the habitation of lionesses? And a feeding-place it `is' for young lions Where walked hath a lion
The lion is tearing parts `for' his whelps
Lo
