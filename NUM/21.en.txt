And the Canaanite -- king Arad -- dwelling in the south
And Israel voweth a vow to Jehovah
and Jehovah hearkeneth to the voice of Israel
And they journey from mount Hor
and the people speak against God
And Jehovah sendeth among the people the burning serpents
and the people come in unto Moses and say
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And Moses maketh a serpent of brass
And the sons of Israel journey
And they journey from Oboth
From thence they have journeyed
From thence they have journeyed
therefore it is said in a book
And the spring of the brooks
And from thence `they journeyed' to Beer; it `is' the well `concerning' which Jehovah said to Moses
Then singeth Israel this song
`A well -- digged it have princes
and from Mattanah to Nahaliel
and from Bamoth in the valley which `is' in the field of Moab `to' the top of Pisgah
And Israel sendeth messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorite
`Let me pass through thy land
And Sihon hath not suffered Israel to pass through his border
And Israel smiteth him by the mouth of the sword
And Israel taketh all these cities
for Heshbon is a city of Sihon king of the Amorite
therefore those using similes say -- `Enter ye Heshbon
For fire hath gone out from Heshbon
Wo to thee
And we shoot them
And Israel dwelleth in the land of the Amorite
and Moses sendeth to spy out Jaazer
and turn and go up the way of Bashan
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And they smite him
