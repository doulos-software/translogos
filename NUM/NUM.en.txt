"04013003","4","13","3","And Moses sendeth them from the wilderness of Paran by the command of Jehovah; all of them `are' men, heads of the sons of Israel they are,"
"04013004","4","13","4","and these their names: For the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur."
"04013005","4","13","5","For the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori."
"04013006","4","13","6","For the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh."

"04013017","4","13","17","And Moses sendeth them to spy the land of Canaan, and saith unto them, `Go ye up this `way' into the south, and ye have gone up the mountain,"
"04013018","4","13","18","and have seen the land what it `is', and the people which is dwelling on it, whether it `is' strong or feeble; whether it `is' few or many;"
"04013019","4","13","19","and what the land `is' in which it is dwelling, whether it `is' good or bad; and what `are' the cities in which it is dwelling, whether in camps or in fortresses;"
"04013020","4","13","20","And what the land `is', whether it `is' fat or lean; whether there is wood in it or not; and ye have strengthened yourselves, and have taken of the fruit of the land;' and the days `are' days of the first-fruits of grapes."
"04013021","4","13","21","And they go up and spy the land, from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob at the going in to Hamath;"
"04013022","4","13","22","and they go up by the south, and come in unto Hebron, and there `are' Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, children of Anak (and Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt),"
"04013023","4","13","23","and they come in unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down thence a branch and one cluster of grapes, and they bear it on a staff by two, also `some' of the pomegranates, and of the figs."
"04013024","4","13","24","That place hath `one' called Brook of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut from thence."

"04013026","4","13","26","And they go and come in unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto all the company of the sons of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and they bring them and all the company back word, and shew them the fruit of the land."
"04013027","4","13","27","And they recount to him, and say, `We came in unto the land whither thou hast sent us, and also it `is' flowing with milk and honey -- and this `is' its fruit;"
"04013028","4","13","28","only, surely the people which is dwelling in the land `is' strong; and the cities are fenced, very great; and also children of Anak we have seen there."
"04013029","4","13","29","Amalek is dwelling in the land of the south, and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite is dwelling in the hill country, and the Canaanite is dwelling by the sea, and by the side of the Jordan.'"
"04013030","4","13","30","And Caleb stilleth the people concerning Moses, and saith, `Let us certainly go up -- and we have possessed it; for we are thoroughly able for it.'"

"04014001","4","14","1","And all the company lifteth up and give forth their voice, and the people weep during that night;"
"04014002","4","14","2","and all the sons of Israel murmur against Moses, and against Aaron, and all the company say unto them, `O that we had died in the land of Egypt, or in this wilderness, O that we had died!"
"04014003","4","14","3","and why is Jehovah bringing us in unto this land to fall by the sword? our wives and our infants are become a prey; is it not good for us to turn back to Egypt?'"
"04014004","4","14","4","And they say one unto another, `Let us appoint a head, and turn back to Egypt.'"
"04014005","4","14","5","And Moses falleth -- Aaron also -- on their faces, before all the assembly of the company of the sons of Israel."
"04014006","4","14","6","And Joshua son of Nun, and Caleb son of Jephunneh, of those spying the land, have rent their garments,"
"04014007","4","14","7","and they speak unto all the company of the sons of Israel, saying, `The land into which we have passed over to spy it, `is' a very very good land;"
"04014008","4","14","8","if Jehovah hath delighted in us, then He hath brought us in unto this land, and hath given it to us, a land which is flowing with milk and honey;"
"04014009","4","14","9","only, against Jehovah rebel not ye: and ye, fear not ye the people of the land, for our bread they `are'; their defence hath turned aside from off them, and Jehovah `is' with us; fear them not.'"
"04014010","4","14","10","And all the company say to stone them with stones, and the honour of Jehovah hath appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the sons of Israel."
"04014011","4","14","11","And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Until when doth this people despise Me? and until when do they not believe in Me, for all the signs which I have done in its midst?"
"04014012","4","14","12","I smite it with pestilence, and dispossess it, and make thee become a nation greater and mightier than it.'"
"04014013","4","14","13","And Moses saith unto Jehovah, `Then have the Egyptians heard! for Thou hast brought up with Thy power this people out of their midst,"
"04014014","4","14","14","and they have said `it' unto the inhabitant of this land, they have heard that Thou, Jehovah, `art' in the midst of this people, that eye to eye Thou art seen -- O Jehovah, and Thy cloud is standing over them, -- and in a pillar of cloud Thou art going before them by day, and in a pillar of fire by night."
"04014015","4","14","15","`And Thou hast put to death this people as one man, and the nations who have heard Thy fame have spoken, saying,"
"04014016","4","14","16","From Jehovah's want of ability to bring in this people unto the land which He hath sworn to them -- He doth slaughter them in the wilderness."
"04014017","4","14","17","`And now, let, I pray Thee, the power of my Lord be great, as Thou hast spoken, saying:"
"04014018","4","14","18","Jehovah `is' slow to anger, and of great kindness; bearing away iniquity and transgression, and not entirely acquitting, charging iniquity of fathers on sons, on a third `generation', and on a fourth; --"
"04014019","4","14","19","forgive, I pray Thee, the iniquity of this people, according to the greatness of Thy kindness, and as Thou hast borne with this people from Egypt, even until now.'"
"04014020","4","14","20","And Jehovah saith, `I have forgiven, according to thy word;"
"04014021","4","14","21","and yet, I live -- and it is filled -- the whole earth -- `with' the honour of Jehovah;"

"04014023","4","14","23","they see not the land which I have sworn to their fathers, yea, none of those despising Me see it;"
"04014024","4","14","24","and My servant Caleb, because there hath been another spirit with him, and he is fully after Me -- I have brought him in unto the land whither he hath entered, and his seed doth possess it."
"04014025","4","14","25","`And the Amalekite and the Canaanite are dwelling in the valley; to-morrow turn ye and journey for yourselves into the wilderness -- the way of the Red Sea.'"
"04014026","4","14","26","And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,"
"04014027","4","14","27","`Until when hath this evil company that which they are murmuring against Me? the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they are murmuring against Me, I have heard;"
"04014028","4","14","28","say unto them, I live -- an affirmation of Jehovah -- if, as ye have spoken in Mine ears -- so I do not to you;"
"04014029","4","14","29","in this wilderness do your carcases fall, even all your numbered ones, to all your number, from a son of twenty years and upward, who have murmured against Me;"
"04014030","4","14","30","ye -- ye come not in unto the land which I have lifted up My hand to cause you to tabernacle in it, except Caleb son of Jephunneh, and Joshua son of Nun."
"04014031","4","14","31","`As to your infants -- of whom ye have said, A spoil they are become -- I have even brought them in, and they have known the land which ye have kicked against;"
"04014032","4","14","32","as to you -- your carcases do fall in this wilderness,"
"04014033","4","14","33","and your sons are evil in the wilderness forty years, and have borne your whoredoms till your carcases are consumed in the wilderness;"
"04014034","4","14","34","by the number of the days `in' which ye spied the land, forty days, -- a day for a year, a day for a year -- ye do bear your iniquities, forty years, and ye have known my breaking off;"
"04014035","4","14","35","I `am' Jehovah, I have spoken; if I do not this to all this evil company who are meeting against me; -- in this wilderness they are consumed, and there they die.'"
"04014036","4","14","36","And the men whom Moses hath sent to spy the land, and they turn back and cause all the company to murmur against him, by bringing out an evil account concerning the land,"
"04014037","4","14","37","even the men bringing out an evil account of the land die by the plague before Jehovah;"
"04014038","4","14","38","and Joshua son of Nun, and Caleb son of Jephunneh, have lived of those men who go to spy out the land."
"04014039","4","14","39","And Moses speaketh these words unto all the sons of Israel, and the people mourn exceedingly,"
"04014040","4","14","40","and they rise early in the morning, and go up unto the top of the mountain, saying, `Here we `are', and we have come up unto the place which Jehovah hath spoken of, for we have sinned.'"
"04014041","4","14","41","And Moses saith, `Why `is' this? -- ye are transgressing the command of Jehovah, and it doth not prosper;"
"04014042","4","14","42","go not up, for Jehovah is not in your midst, and ye are not smitten before your enemies;"
"04014043","4","14","43","for the Amalekite and the Canaanite `are' there before you, and ye have fallen by the sword, because that ye have turned back from after Jehovah, and Jehovah is not with you.'"
"04014044","4","14","44","And they presume to go up unto the top of the mountain, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and Moses have not departed out of the midst of the camp."
"04014045","4","14","45","And the Amalekite and the Canaanite who are dwelling in that mountain come down and smite them, and beat them down -- unto Hormah."
"04015001","4","15","1","And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
"04015002","4","15","2","`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When ye come in unto the land of your dwellings, which I am giving to you,"
"04015003","4","15","3","then ye have prepared a fire-offering to Jehovah, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, at separating a vow or free-will-offering, or in your appointed things, to make a sweet fragrance to Jehovah, out of the herd, or out of the flock."
"04015004","4","15","4","`And he who is bringing near his offering to Jehovah hath brought near a present of flour, a tenth deal, mixed with a fourth of the hin of oil;"

"04015006","4","15","6","or for a ram thou dost prepare a present of flour, two-tenth deals, mixed with oil, a third of the hin;"
"04015007","4","15","7","and wine for a libation, a third part of the hin, thou dost bring near -- a sweet fragrance to Jehovah."
"04015008","4","15","8","`And when thou makest a son of the herd a burnt-offering or a sacrifice, at separating a vow or peace-offerings to Jehovah,"
"04015009","4","15","9","then he hath brought near for the son of the herd a present of flour, three-tenth deals, mixed with oil, a half of the hin;"
"04015010","4","15","10","and wine thou bringest near for a libation, a half of the hin -- a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah;"
"04015011","4","15","11","thus it is done for the one ox, or for the one ram, or for a lamb of the sheep or of the goats."
"04015012","4","15","12","`According to the number that ye prepare, so ye do to each, according to their number;"
"04015013","4","15","13","every native doth thus with these, at bringing near a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah;"
"04015014","4","15","14","and when a sojourner sojourneth with you, or whoso `is' in your midst to your generations, and he hath made a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah, as ye do so he doth."
"04015015","4","15","15","`One statute is for you of the congregation and for the sojourner who is sojourning, a statute age-during to your generations: as ye `are' so is the sojourner before Jehovah;"

"04015020","4","15","20","the beginning of your dough a cake ye heave up -- a heave-offering; as the heave-offering of a threshing-floor, so ye do heave it."
"04015021","4","15","21","Of the beginning of your dough ye do give to Jehovah a heave-offering -- to your generations."
"04015022","4","15","22","`And when ye err, and do not all these commands which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses,"
"04015023","4","15","23","the whole that Jehovah hath charged upon you by the hand of Moses, from the day that Jehovah hath commanded, and henceforth, to your generations,"
"04015024","4","15","24","then it hath been, if from the eyes of the company it hath been done in ignorance, that all the company have prepared one bullock, a son of the herd, for a burnt-offering, for sweet fragrance to Jehovah, and its present, and its libation, according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering."
"04015025","4","15","25","`And the priest hath made atonement for all the company of the sons of Israel, and it hath been forgiven them, for it `is' ignorance, and they -- they have brought in their offering, a fire-offering to Jehovah, even their sin-offering before Jehovah for their ignorance;"
"04015026","4","15","26","and it hath been forgiven to all the company of the sons of Israel, and to the sojourner who is sojourning in their midst; for to all the company `it is done' in ignorance."
"04015027","4","15","27","`And if one person sin in ignorance, then he hath brought near a she-goat, daughter of a year, for a sin-offering;"
"04015028","4","15","28","and the priest hath made atonement for the person who is erring, in his sinning in ignorance before Jehovah, by making atonement for him, and it hath been forgiven him;"
"04015029","4","15","29","for the native among the sons of Israel, and for the sojourner who is sojourning in their midst -- one law is to you, for him who is doing `anything' through ignorance."
"04015030","4","15","30","`And the person who doth `aught' with a high hand -- of the native or of the sojourner -- Jehovah he is reviling, and that person hath been cut off from the midst of his people;"

"04015032","4","15","32","And the sons of Israel are in the wilderness, and they find a man gathering wood on the sabbath-day,"
"04015033","4","15","33","and those finding him gathering wood bring him near unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto all the company,"
"04015034","4","15","34","and they place him in ward, for it `is' not explained what is `to be' done to him."
"04015035","4","15","35","And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `The man is certainly put to death, all the company stoning him with stones, at the outside of the camp.'"
"04015036","4","15","36","And all the company bring him out unto the outside of the camp, and stone him with stones, and he dieth, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."

"04015038","4","15","38","`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, and they have made for themselves fringes on the skirts of their garments, to their generations, and they have put on the fringe of the skirt a ribbon of blue,"

"04015040","4","15","40","so that ye remember and have done all My commands, and ye have been holy to your God;"
"04015041","4","15","41","I `am' Jehovah your God, who hath brought you out from the land of Egypt to become your God; I, Jehovah, `am' your God.'"
"04016001","4","16","1","And Korah, son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, taketh both Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, sons of Reuben,"

"04016010","4","16","10","yea, He doth bring thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee -- and ye have sought also the priesthood!"

"04016014","4","16","14","Yea, unto a land flowing with milk and honey thou hast not brought us in, nor dost thou give to us an inheritance of field and vineyard; the eyes of these men dost thou pick out? we do not come up.'"
"04016015","4","16","15","And it is very displeasing to Moses, and he saith unto Jehovah, `Turn not Thou unto their present; not one ass from them have I taken, nor have I afflicted one of them.'"

"04016027","4","16","27","And they go up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan and Abiram, from round about, and Dathan, and Abiram have come out, standing at the opening of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their infants."

"04016039","4","16","39","And Eleazar the priest taketh the brazen censers which they who are burnt had brought near, and they spread them out, a covering for the altar --"
"04016040","4","16","40","a memorial to the sons of Israel, so that a stranger who is not of the seed of Aaron doth not draw near to make a perfume before Jehovah, and is not as Korah, and as his company, -- as Jehovah hath spoken by the hand of Moses to him."
"04016041","4","16","41","And all the company of the sons of Israel murmur, on the morrow, against Moses and against Aaron, saying, `Ye -- ye have put to death the people of Jehovah.'"
"04016042","4","16","42","And it cometh to pass, in the company being assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they turn towards the tent of meeting, and lo, the cloud hath covered it, and the honour of Jehovah is seen;"
"04016043","4","16","43","and Moses cometh -- Aaron also -- unto the front of the tent of meeting."
"04016044","4","16","44","And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
"04016045","4","16","45","`Get you up from the midst of this company, and I consume them in a moment;' and they fall on their faces,"
"04016046","4","16","46","and Moses saith unto Aaron, `Take the censer, and put on it fire from off the altar, and place perfume, and go, hasten unto the company, and make atonement for them, for the wrath hath gone out from the presence of Jehovah -- the plague hath begun.'"
"04016047","4","16","47","And Aaron taketh as Moses hath spoken, and runneth unto the midst of the assembly, and lo, the plague hath begun among the people; and he giveth the perfume, and maketh atonement for the people,"
"04016048","4","16","48","and standeth between the dead and the living, and the plague is restrained;"
"04016049","4","16","49","and those who die by the plague are fourteen thousand and seven hundred, apart from those who die for the matter of Korah;"
"04016050","4","16","50","and Aaron turneth back unto Moses, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and the plague hath been restrained."
"04017001","4","17","1","And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
"04017002","4","17","2","`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and take from them each a rod, for a father's house, from all their princes, for the house of their fathers, twelve rods; the name of each thou dost write on his rod,"

"04017004","4","17","4","and thou hast placed them in the tent of meeting, before the testimony, where I meet with you."
"04017005","4","17","5","`And it hath come to pass, the man's rod on whom I fix doth flourish, and I have caused to cease from off me the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they are murmuring against you.'"
"04017006","4","17","6","And Moses speaketh unto the sons of Israel, and all their princes give unto him one rod for a prince, one rod for a prince, for their fathers' house, twelve rods, and the rod of Aaron `is' in the midst of their rods;"

"04017008","4","17","8","And it cometh to pass, on the morrow, that Moses goeth in unto the tent of the testimony, and lo, the rod of Aaron hath flourished for the house of Levi, and is bringing out flourishing, and doth blossom blossoms, and doth produce almonds;"
"04017009","4","17","9","and Moses bringeth out all the rods from before Jehovah, unto all the sons of Israel, and they look, and take each his rod."
"04017010","4","17","10","And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Put back the rod of Aaron, before the testimony, for a charge, for a sign to the sons of rebellion, and thou dost remove their murmurings from off me, and they do not die;'"
"04017011","4","17","11","and Moses doth as Jehovah hath commanded him; so he hath done."
"04017012","4","17","12","And the sons of Israel speak unto Moses, saying, `Lo, we have expired; we have perished; we have all of us perished;"

"04018003","4","18","3","`And they have kept thy charge, and the charge of all the tent; only, unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar they do not come near, and they die not, either they or you;"
"04018004","4","18","4","and they have been joined unto thee, and have kept the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; and a stranger doth not come near unto you;"
"04018005","4","18","5","and ye have kept the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar, and there is no more wrath against the sons of Israel."
"04018006","4","18","6","`And I, lo, I have taken your brethren the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel; to you a gift they are given by Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting;"

"04018008","4","18","8","And Jehovah speaketh unto Aaron: `And I, lo, I have given to thee the charge of My heave-offerings, of all the hallowed things of the sons of Israel -- to thee I have given them for the anointing, and to thy sons, by a statute age-during."
"04018009","4","18","9","This is thine of the most holy things, from the fire: all their offering, to all their present, and to all their sin-offering, and to all their guilt-offering, which they give back to Me, is most holy to thee, and to thy sons;"

"04022003","4","22","3","and Moab is exceedingly afraid of the presence of the people, for it `is' numerous; and Moab is vexed by the presence of the sons of Israel,"
"04022004","4","22","4","and Moab saith unto the elders of Midian, `Now doth the assembly lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the green thing of the field.' And Balak son of Zippor `is' king of Moab at that time,"
"04022005","4","22","5","and he sendeth messengers unto Balaam son of Beor, to Pethor, which `is' by the River of the land of the sons of his people, to call for him, saying, `Lo, a people hath come out of Egypt; lo, it hath covered the eye of the land, and it is abiding over-against me;"
"04022006","4","22","6","and now, come, I pray thee, curse for me this people, for it `is' mightier than I; it may be I prevail -- we smite it -- and I cast it out from the land; for I have known -- that which thou blessest is blessed, and that which thou cursest is cursed.'"
"04022007","4","22","7","And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian go, and divinations in their hand, and they come in unto Balaam, and speak unto him the words of Balak,"
"04022008","4","22","8","and he saith unto them, `Lodge here to-night, and I have brought you back word, as Jehovah speaketh unto me;' and the princes of Moab abide with Balaam."
"04022009","4","22","9","And God cometh in unto Balaam, and saith, `Who `are' these men with thee?'"
"04022010","4","22","10","And Balaam saith unto God, `Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me:"
"04022011","4","22","11","Lo, the people that is coming out from Egypt and covereth the eye of the land, -- now come, pierce it for me; it may be I am able to fight against it, and have cast it out;'"
"04022012","4","22","12","and God saith unto Balaam, `Thou dost not go with them; thou dost not curse the people; for it `is' blessed.'"
"04022013","4","22","13","And Balaam riseth in the morning, and saith unto the princes of Balak, `Go unto your land, for Jehovah is refusing to suffer me to go with you;'"
"04022014","4","22","14","and the princes of Moab rise, and come in unto Balak, and say, `Balaam is refusing to come with us.'"
"04022015","4","22","15","And Balak addeth yet to send princes, more numerous and honoured than these,"
"04022016","4","22","16","and they come in unto Balaam, and say to him, `Thus said Balak son of Zippor, Be not, I pray thee, withheld from coming unto me,"
"04022017","4","22","17","for very greatly I honour thee, and all that thou sayest unto me I do; and come, I pray thee, pierce for me this people.'"
"04022018","4","22","18","And Balaam answereth and saith unto the servants of Balak, `If Balak doth give to me the fulness of his house of silver and gold, I am not able to pass over the command of Jehovah my God, to do a little or a great thing;"
"04022019","4","22","19","and, now, abide, I pray you, in this `place', you also, to-night; and I know what Jehovah is adding to speak with me.'"
"04022020","4","22","20","And God cometh in unto Balaam, by night, and saith to him, `If to call for thee the men have come, rise, go with them, and only the thing which I speak unto thee -- it thou dost do.'"
"04022021","4","22","21","And Balaam riseth in the morning, and saddleth his ass, and goeth with the princes of Moab,"
"04022022","4","22","22","and the anger of God burneth because he is going, and a messenger of Jehovah stationeth himself in the way for an adversary to him, and he is riding on his ass, and two of his servants `are' with him,"
"04022023","4","22","23","and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his drawn sword in his hand, and the ass turneth aside out of the way, and goeth into a field, and Balaam smiteth the ass to turn it aside into the way."
"04022024","4","22","24","And the messenger of Jehovah standeth in a narrow path of the vineyards -- a wall on this `side' and a wall on that --"
"04022025","4","22","25","and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah, and is pressed unto the wall, and presseth Balaam's foot unto the wall, and he addeth to smite her;"
"04022026","4","22","26","and the messenger of Jehovah addeth to pass over, and standeth in a strait place where there is no way to turn aside -- right or left --"
"04022027","4","22","27","and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah, and croucheth under Balaam, and the anger of Balaam burneth, and he smiteth the ass with a staff."
"04022028","4","22","28","And Jehovah openeth the mouth of the ass, and she saith to Balaam, `What have I done to thee that thou hast smitten me these three times?'"
"04022029","4","22","29","and Balaam saith to the ass, `Because thou hast rolled thyself against me; oh that there were a sword in my hand, for now I had slain thee;'"
"04022030","4","22","30","and the ass saith unto Balaam, `Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden since `I was' thine unto this day? have I at all been accustomed to do to thee thus?' and he saith, `No.'"
"04022031","4","22","31","And Jehovah uncovereth the eyes of Balaam, and he seeeth the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his drawn sword in his hand, and he boweth and doth obeisance, to his face;"
"04022032","4","22","32","and the messenger of Jehovah saith unto him, `Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? lo, I -- I have come out for an adversary, for `thy' way hath been perverse before me,"
"04022033","4","22","33","and the ass seeth me, and turneth aside at my presence these three times; unless she had turned aside from my presence, surely now also, thee I had slain, and her kept alive.'"
"04022034","4","22","34","And Balaam saith unto the messenger of Jehovah, `I have sinned, for I did not know that thou `art' standing to meet me in the way; and now, if evil in thine eyes -- I turn back by myself.'"
"04022035","4","22","35","And the messenger of Jehovah saith unto Balaam, `Go with the men; and only the word which I speak unto thee -- it thou dost speak;' and Balaam goeth with the princes of Balak."

"04022038","4","22","38","And Balaam saith unto Balak, `Lo, I have come unto thee; now -- am I at all able to speak anything? the word which God setteth in my mouth -- it I do speak.'"
"04022039","4","22","39","And Balaam goeth with Balak, and they come to Kirjath-Huzoth,"
"04022040","4","22","40","and Balak sacrificeth oxen and sheep, and sendeth to Balaam, and to the princes who `are' with him;"
"04022041","4","22","41","and it cometh to pass in the morning, that Balak taketh Balaam, and causeth him to go up the high places of Baal, and he seeth from thence the extremity of the people."
"04023001","4","23","1","And Balaam saith unto Balak, `Build for me in this `place' seven altars, and make ready for me in this `place' seven bullocks and seven rams.'"

"04023004","4","23","4","And God cometh unto Balaam, and he saith unto Him, `The seven altars I have arranged, and I offer a bullock and a ram on the altar;'"
"04023005","4","23","5","and Jehovah putteth a word in the mouth of Balaam, and saith, `Turn back unto Balak, and thus thou dost speak.'"
"04023006","4","23","6","And he turneth back unto him, and lo, he is standing by his burnt-offering, he and all the princes of Moab."
"04023007","4","23","7","And he taketh up his simile, and saith: `From Aram he doth lead me -- Balak king of Moab; From mountains of the east: Come -- curse for me Jacob, And come -- be indignant `with' Israel."
"04023008","4","23","8","What -- do I pierce? -- God hath not pierced! And what -- am I indignant? -- Jehovah hath not been indignant!"

"04023013","4","23","13","And Balak saith unto him, `Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, whence thou dost see it, only its extremity thou dost see, and all of it thou dost not see, and pierce it for me thence;'"
"04023014","4","23","14","and he taketh him `to' the field of Zophim, unto the top of Pisgah, and buildeth seven altars, and offereth a bullock and a ram on the altar."
"04023015","4","23","15","And he saith unto Balak, `Station thyself here by thy burnt-offering, and I -- I meet `Him' there;'"
"04023016","4","23","16","and Jehovah cometh unto Balaam, and setteth a word in his mouth, and saith, `Turn back unto Balak, and thus thou dost speak.'"
"04023017","4","23","17","And he cometh unto him, and lo, he is standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him, and Balak saith to him: `What hath Jehovah spoken?'"

"04023019","4","23","19","God `is' not a man -- and lieth, And a son of man -- and repenteth! Hath He said -- and doth He not do `it'? And spoken -- and doth He not confirm it?"
"04023020","4","23","20","Lo, to bless I have received: Yea, He blesseth, and I `can'not reverse it."

"04024016","4","24","16","An affirmation of him who is hearing sayings of God -- And knowing knowledge of the Most High; A vision of the Almighty he seeth, Falling -- and eyes uncovered:"
"04024017","4","24","17","I see it, but not now; I behold it, but not near; A star hath proceeded from Jacob, And a sceptre hath risen from Israel, And hath smitten corners of Moab, And hath destroyed all sons of Sheth."
"04024018","4","24","18","And Edom hath been a possession, And Seir hath been a possession, `for' its enemies, And Israel is doing valiantly;"

"04024023","4","24","23","And he taketh up his simile, and saith: `Alas! who doth live when God doth this?"

"04025001","4","25","1","And Israel dwelleth in Shittim, and the people begin to go a-whoring unto daughters of Moab,"
"04025002","4","25","2","and they call for the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people eat, and bow themselves to their gods,"
"04025003","4","25","3","and Israel is joined to Baal-Peor, and the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel."

"04035013","4","35","13","`As to the cities which ye give -- six `are' cities of refuge to you;"
"04035014","4","35","14","the three of the cities ye give beyond the Jordan, and the three of the cities ye give in the land of Canaan; cities of refuge they are."
"04035015","4","35","15","To sons of Israel, and to a sojourner, and to a settler in their midst, are these six cities for a refuge, for the fleeing thither of any one smiting a person unawares."
"04035016","4","35","16","`And if with an instrument of iron he hath smitten him, and he dieth, he `is' a murderer: the murderer is certainly put to death."
"04035017","4","35","17","`And if with a stone `in' the hand, wherewith he dieth, he hath smitten him, and he dieth, he `is' a murderer: the murderer is certainly put to death."
"04035018","4","35","18","`Or with a wooden instrument `in' the hand, wherewith he dieth, he hath smitten him, and he dieth, he `is' a murderer: the murderer is certainly put to death."
"04035019","4","35","19","`The redeemer of blood himself doth put the murderer to death; in his coming against him he doth put him to death."
"04035020","4","35","20","`And if in hatred he thrust him through, or hath cast `anything' at him by lying in wait, and he dieth;"
"04035021","4","35","21","or in enmity he hath smitten him with his hand, and he dieth; the smiter is certainly put to death; he `is' a murderer; the redeemer of blood doth put the murderer to death in his coming against him."
"04035022","4","35","22","`And if, in an instant, without enmity, he hath thrust him through, or hath cast at him any instrument, without lying in wait;"
"04035023","4","35","23","or with any stone wherewith he dieth, without seeing, and causeth `it' to fall upon him, and he dieth, and he `is' not his enemy, nor seeking his evil;"
"04035024","4","35","24","then have the company judged between the smiter and the redeemer of blood, by these judgments."
"04035025","4","35","25","`And the company have delivered the man-slayer out of the hand of the redeemer of blood, and the company have caused him to turn back unto the city of his refuge, whither he hath fled, and he hath dwelt in it till the death of the chief priest, who hath been anointed with the holy oil."
"04035026","4","35","26","`And if the man-slayer at all go out `from' the border of the city of his refuge whither he fleeth,"
"04035027","4","35","27","and the redeemer of blood hath found him at the outside of the border of the city of his refuge, and the redeemer of blood hath slain the man-slayer, blood is not for him;"
"04035028","4","35","28","for in the city of his refuge he doth dwell till the death of the chief priest; and after the death of the chief priest doth the man-slayer turn back unto the city of his possession."
"04035029","4","35","29","`And these things have been to you for a statute of judgment to your generations, in all your dwellings:"
"04035030","4","35","30","whoso smiteth a person, by the mouth of witnesses doth `one' slay the murderer; and one witness doth not testify against a person -- to die."
"04035031","4","35","31","`And ye take no atonement for the life of a murderer who `is' condemned -- to die, for he is certainly put to death;"
"04035032","4","35","32","and ye take no atonement for him to flee unto the city of his refuge, to turn back to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest."
"04035033","4","35","33","`And ye profane not the land which ye `are' in, for blood profaneth the land; as to the land, it is not pardoned for blood which is shed in it except by the blood of him who sheddeth it;"
"04035034","4","35","34","and ye defile not the land in which ye are dwelling, in the midst of which I do tabernacle, for I Jehovah do tabernacle in the midst of the sons of Israel.'"
"04036001","4","36","1","And the heads of the fathers of the families of the sons of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, come near, and speak before Moses, and before the princes, heads of the fathers of the sons of Israel,"

"04036003","4","36","3","`And -- they have been to one of the sons of the `other' tribes of the sons of Israel for wives, and their inheritance hath been withdrawn from the inheritance of our fathers, and hath been added to the inheritance of the tribe which is theirs, and from the lot of our inheritance it is withdrawn,"
"04036004","4","36","4","and if it is the jubilee of the sons of Israel, then hath their inheritance been added to the inheritance of the tribe which is theirs, and from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers is their inheritance withdrawn.'"
"04036005","4","36","5","And Moses commandeth the sons of Israel, by the command of Jehovah, saying, `Rightly are the tribe of the sons of Joseph speaking;"
"04036006","4","36","6","this `is' the thing which Jehovah hath commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, To those good in their eyes let them be for wives; only, to a family of the tribe of their fathers let them be for wives;"
"04036007","4","36","7","and the inheritance of the sons of Israel doth not turn round from tribe unto tribe; for each to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers, do the sons of Israel cleave."
"04036008","4","36","8","`And every daughter possessing an inheritance, of the tribes of the sons of Israel, is to one of the family of the tribe of her father for a wife, so that the sons of Israel possess each the inheritance of his fathers,"

"04036010","4","36","10","As Jehovah hath commanded Moses, so have the daughters of Zelophehad done,"
"04036011","4","36","11","and Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, daughters of Zelophehad, are to the sons of their fathers' brethren for wives;"
"04036012","4","36","12","`to men' of the families of the sons of Manasseh, son of Joseph, they have been for wives, and their inheritance is with the tribe of the family of their father."
"04036013","4","36","13","These `are' the commands and the judgments which Jehovah hath commanded, by the hand of Moses, concerning the sons of Israel, in the plains of Moab, by Jordan, `near' Jericho."
