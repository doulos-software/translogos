And Miriam speaketh -- Aaron also -- against Moses concerning the circumstance of the Cushite woman whom he had taken: for a Cushite woman he had taken;"
and they say
And the man Moses `is' very humble
And Jehovah saith suddenly unto Moses
And Jehovah cometh down in the pillar of the cloud
And He saith
not so My servant Moses; in all My house he `is' stedfast;"
mouth unto mouth I speak with him
And the anger of Jehovah burneth against them
and the cloud hath turned aside from off the tent
And Aaron saith unto Moses
let her not
And Moses crieth unto Jehovah
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And Miriam is shut out at the outside of the camp seven days
and afterwards have the people journeyed from Hazeroth
