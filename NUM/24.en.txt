And Balaam seeth that `it is' good in the eyes of Jehovah to bless Israel
and Balaam lifteth up his eyes
and he taketh up his simile
An affirmation of him who is hearing sayings of God -- Who a vision of the Almighty seeth
How good have been thy tents
As valleys they have been stretched out
He maketh water flow from his buckets
God is bringing him out of Egypt; As the swiftness of a Reem is to him
He hath bent
And the anger of Balak burneth against Balaam
and now
And Balaam saith unto Balak
If Balak doth give to me the fulness of his house of silver and gold
and
And he taketh up his simile
An affirmation of him who is hearing sayings of God -- And knowing knowledge of the Most High; A vision of the Almighty he seeth
I see it
And Edom hath been a possession
And `one' doth rule out of Jacob
And he seeth Amalek
And he seeth the Kenite
But the Kenite is for a burning; Till when doth Asshur keep thee captive?'"
And he taketh up his simile
And -- ships `are' from the side of Chittim
And Balaam riseth
