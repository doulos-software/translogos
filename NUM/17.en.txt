And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
and Aaron's name thou dost write on the tribe of Levi; for one rod `is' for the head of their fathers' house:"
and thou hast placed them in the tent of meeting
`And it hath come to pass
And Moses speaketh unto the sons of Israel
and Moses placeth the rods before Jehovah
And it cometh to pass
and Moses bringeth out all the rods from before Jehovah
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and Moses doth as Jehovah hath commanded him; so he hath done."
And the sons of Israel speak unto Moses
any who is at all drawing near unto the tabernacle of Jehovah dieth; have we not been consumed -- to expire?'"
