And these `are' births of Aaron and Moses
And these `are' the names of the sons of Aaron: the first-born Nadab
these `are' the names of the sons of Aaron
And Nadab dieth -- Abihu also -- before Jehovah
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Bring near the tribe of Levi
and kept his charge
and they have kept all the vessels of the tent of meeting
and thou hast given the Levites to Aaron and to his sons; they are surely given to him out of the sons of Israel."
`And Aaron and his sons thou dost appoint
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`And I
for Mine `is' every first-born
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai
`Number the sons of Levi by the house of their fathers
And Moses numbereth them according to the command of Jehovah
And these are sons of Levi by their names: Gershon
And these `are' the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei."
And the sons of Kohath
And the sons of Merari by their families `are' Mahli and Mushi; these are the families of the Levites
Of Gershon `is' the family of the Libnite
Their numbered ones
The families of the Gershonite
And the prince of a father's house for the Gershonite `is' Eliasaph son of Lael."
And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting `is' the tabernacle
and the hangings of the court
And of Kohath `is' the family of the Amramite
In number
The families of the sons of Kohath encamp by the side of the tabernacle southward."
And the prince of a father's house for the families of the Kohathite `is' Elizaphan son of Uzziel."
And their charge `is' the ark
And `to' the prince of the princes of the Levites
Of Merari `is' the family of the Mahlite
And their numbered ones
And the prince of a father's house for the families of Merari `is' Zuriel son of Abihail; by the side of the tabernacle they encamp northward."
And the oversight -- the charge of the sons of Merari -- `is' the boards of the tabernacle
and the pillars of the court round about
And those encamping before the tabernacle eastward
All those numbered of the Levites whom Moses numbered -- Aaron also -- by the command of Jehovah
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and thou hast taken the Levites for Me (I `am' Jehovah)
And Moses numbereth
And all the first-born -- male -- by the number of names
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Take the Levites instead of every first-born among the sons of Israel
`And `from' those ransomed of the two hundred and seventy and three (who are more than the Levites) of the first-born of the sons of Israel
thou hast even taken five shekels a-piece by the poll -- by the shekel of the sanctuary thou takest; twenty gerahs the shekel `is';"
and thou hast given the money to Aaron
And Moses taketh the ransom money from those over and above those ransomed by the Levites;"
from the first-born of the sons of Israel he hath taken the money
and Moses giveth the money of those ransomed to Aaron
