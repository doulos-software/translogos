And daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher
and stand before Moses
`Our father died in the wilderness
why is the name of our father withdrawn from the midst of his family because he hath no son? give to us a possession in the midst of the brethren of our father;'"
and Moses bringeth near their cause before Jehovah."
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Rightly are the daughters of Zelophehad speaking; thou dost certainly give to them a possession of an inheritance in the midst of their father's brethren
`And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak
and if he have no daughter
and if he have no brethren
and if his father have no brethren
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and thou hast seen it
because ye provoked My mouth in the wilderness of Zin
And Moses speaketh unto Jehovah
`Jehovah -- God of the spirits of all flesh -- appoint a man over the company
who goeth out before them
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and hast caused him to stand before Eleazar the priest
and hast put of thine honour upon him
`And before Eleazar the priest he standeth
And Moses doth as Jehovah hath commanded him
and layeth his hands upon him
