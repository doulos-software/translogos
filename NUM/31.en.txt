And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Execute the vengeance of the sons of Israel against the Midianites -- afterwards thou art gathered unto thy people.'"
And Moses speaketh unto the people
a thousand for a tribe -- a thousand for a tribe
And there are given out of the thousands of Israel a thousand for a tribe
and Moses sendeth them
And they war against Midian
and the kings of Midian they have slain
And the sons of Israel take captive the women of Midian
and all their cities
And they take all the spoil
and they bring in
And Moses
and Moses is wroth against the inspectors of the force
And Moses saith unto them
lo
`And now
and all the infants among the women
`And ye
and every garment
And Eleazar the priest saith unto the men of the host who go in to battle
only
every thing which may go into fire
and ye have washed your garments on the seventh day
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Take up the sum of the prey of the captives
and thou hast halved the prey between those handling the battle who go out to the host and all the company;"
and thou hast raised a tribute to Jehovah from the men of war
from their half ye do take
`And from the sons of Israel's half thou dost take one possession out of fifty
And Moses doth -- Eleazar the priest also -- as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."
And the prey
and of the herd two and seventy thousand;"
and of asses one and sixty thousand;"
and of human beings -- of the women who have not known the lying of a male -- all the persons `are' two and thirty thousand."
And the half -- the portion of those who go out into the host -- the number of the flock is three hundred thousand
And the tribute to Jehovah of the sheep is six hundred five and seventy;"
and the herd `is' six and thirty thousand
and the asses `are' thirty thousand and five hundred
and the human beings `are' sixteen thousand
And Moses giveth the tribute -- Jehovah's heave-offering -- to Eleazar the priest
And of the sons of Israel's half
and the company's half is
and of the herd six and thirty thousand;"
and of asses thirty thousand and five hundred;"
and of human beings sixteen thousand --"
Moses taketh from the sons of Israel's half the one possession from the fifty
And the inspectors whom the thousands of the host hath
and they say unto Moses
and we bring near Jehovah's offering
And Moses receiveth -- Eleazar the priest also -- the gold from them
and all the gold of the heave-offering which they have lifted up to Jehovah is sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels
(the men of the host have spoiled each for himself);"
and Moses taketh -- Eleazar the priest also -- the gold from the heads of the thousands and of the hundreds
