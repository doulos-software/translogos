And the heads of the fathers of the families of the sons of Gilead
and say
`And -- they have been to one of the sons of the `other' tribes of the sons of Israel for wives
and if it is the jubilee of the sons of Israel
And Moses commandeth the sons of Israel
this `is' the thing which Jehovah hath commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad
and the inheritance of the sons of Israel doth not turn round from tribe unto tribe; for each to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers
`And every daughter possessing an inheritance
and the inheritance doth not turn round from `one' tribe to another tribe; for each to his inheritance do they cleave
As Jehovah hath commanded Moses
and Mahlah
`to men' of the families of the sons of Manasseh
These `are' the commands and the judgments which Jehovah hath commanded
