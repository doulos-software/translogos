And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
then ye have prepared a fire-offering to Jehovah
`And he who is bringing near his offering to Jehovah hath brought near a present of flour
and wine for a libation
or for a ram thou dost prepare a present of flour
and wine for a libation
`And when thou makest a son of the herd a burnt-offering or a sacrifice
then he hath brought near for the son of the herd a present of flour
and wine thou bringest near for a libation
thus it is done for the one ox
`According to the number that ye prepare
every native doth thus with these
and when a sojourner sojourneth with you
`One statute is for you of the congregation and for the sojourner who is sojourning
one law and one ordinance is to you and to the sojourner who is sojourning with you.'"
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
then it hath been
the beginning of your dough a cake ye heave up -- a heave-offering; as the heave-offering of a threshing-floor
Of the beginning of your dough ye do give to Jehovah a heave-offering -- to your generations."
`And when ye err
the whole that Jehovah hath charged upon you by the hand of Moses
then it hath been
`And the priest hath made atonement for all the company of the sons of Israel
and it hath been forgiven to all the company of the sons of Israel
`And if one person sin in ignorance
and the priest hath made atonement for the person who is erring
for the native among the sons of Israel
`And the person who doth `aught' with a high hand -- of the native or of the sojourner -- Jehovah he is reviling
because the word of Jehovah he despised
And the sons of Israel are in the wilderness
and those finding him gathering wood bring him near unto Moses
and they place him in ward
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And all the company bring him out unto the outside of the camp
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
and it hath been to you for a fringe
so that ye remember and have done all My commands
I `am' Jehovah your God
