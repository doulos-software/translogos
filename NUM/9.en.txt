And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Also
in the fourteenth day of this month between the evenings ye prepare it in its appointed season; according to all its statutes
And Moses speaketh unto the sons of Israel to prepare the passover
and they prepare the passover in the first `month'
And there are men who have been defiled by the body of a man
and those men say unto him
And Moses saith unto them
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
in the second month
they do not leave of till morning; and a bone they do not break in it: according to all the statute of the passover they prepare it."
`And the man who is clean
`And when a sojourner sojourneth with you
And in the day of the raising up of the tabernacle hath the cloud covered the tabernacle
so it is continually; the cloud covereth it
And according to the going up of the cloud from off the tent and afterwards do the sons of Israel journey; and in the place where the cloud doth tabernacle
by the command of Jehovah the sons of Israel journey
And in the cloud prolonging itself over the tabernacle many days
and so when the cloud is a number of days over the tabernacle; by the command of Jehovah they encamp
And so when the cloud is from evening till morning
Whether two days
by the command of Jehovah they encamp
