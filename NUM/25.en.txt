And Israel dwelleth in Shittim
and they call for the people to the sacrifices of their gods
and Israel is joined to Baal-Peor
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And Moses saith unto the judges of Israel
And lo
and Phinehas
and goeth in after the man of Israel unto the hollow place
and the dead by the plague are four and twenty thousand."
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Phinehas
`Therefore say
and it hath been to him and to his seed after him a covenant of a priesthood age-during
And the name of the man of Israel who is smitten
and the name of the woman who is smitten
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Distress the Midianites
for they are adversaries to you with their frauds
