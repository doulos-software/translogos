And the people is evil
And the people cry unto Moses
and he calleth the name of that place Taberah
And the rabble who `are' in its midst have lusted greatly
We have remembered the fish which we do eat in Egypt for nought
and now our soul `is' dry
And the manna is as coriander seed
the people have turned aside and gathered `it'
And in the descending of the dew on the camp by night
And Moses heareth the people weeping by its families
And Moses saith unto Jehovah
I -- have I conceived all this people? I -- have I begotten it
Whence have I flesh to give to all this people? for they weep unto me
I am not able -- I alone -- to bear all this people
and if thus Thou art doing to me -- slay me
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and I have come down and spoken with thee there
`And unto the people thou dost say
Ye do not eat one day
unto a month of days
And Moses saith
Is flock and herd slaughtered for them
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
And Moses goeth out
and Jehovah cometh down in the cloud
And two of the men are left in the camp
and the young man runneth
And Joshua son of Nun
And Moses saith to him
And Moses is gathered unto the camp
And a spirit hath journeyed from Jehovah
And the people rise all that day
The flesh is yet between their teeth -- it is not yet cut off -- and the anger of Jehovah hath burned among the people
and `one' calleth the name of that place Kibroth-Hattaavah
From Kibroth-Hattaavah have the people journeyed to Hazeroth
