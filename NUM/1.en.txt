And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai
`Take ye up the sum of all the company of the sons of Israel by their families
from a son of twenty years and upward
and with you there is a man for a tribe
`And these `are' the names of the men who stand with you: `For Reuben -- Elizur son of Shedeur."
`For Simeon -- Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai."
`For Judah -- Nahshon son of Amminadab."
`For Issachar -- Nathaneel son of Zuar."
`For Zebulun -- Eliab son of Helon."
`For the sons of Joseph -- for Ephraim: Elishama son of Ammihud: for Manasseh -- Gamaliel son of Pedahzur."
`For Benjamin -- Abidan son of Gideoni."
`For Dan -- Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai."
`For Asher -- Pagiel son of Ocran."
`For Gad -- Eliasaph son of Deuel."
`For Naphtali -- Ahira son of Enan.'"
These `are' those called of the company
And Moses taketh -- Aaron also -- these men
and all the company they assembled on the first of the second month
as Jehovah hath commanded Moses; and he numbereth them in the wilderness of Sinai."
And the sons of Reuben
their numbered ones
Of the sons of Simeon -- their births
their numbered ones
Of the sons of Gad -- their births
their numbered ones
Of the sons of Judah -- their births
their numbered ones
Of the sons of Issachar -- their births
their numbered ones
Of the sons of Zebulun -- their births
their numbered ones
Of the sons of Joseph -- of the sons of Ephraim -- their births
their numbered ones
Of the sons of Manasseh -- their births
their numbered ones
Of the sons of Benjamin -- their births
their numbered ones
Of the sons of Dan -- their births
their numbered ones
Of the sons of Asher -- their births

`Of' the sons of Naphtali -- their births

These `are' those numbered
And they are
yea
And the Levites
seeing Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Only
and thou
`And in the journeying of the tabernacle
And the sons of Israel have encamped
and the Levites encamp round about the tabernacle of the testimony; and there is no wrath on the company of the sons of Israel
And the sons of Israel do according to all that Jehovah hath commanded Moses; so they have done."
