And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Send for thee men
And Moses sendeth them from the wilderness of Paran by the command of Jehovah; all of them `are' men
and these their names: For the tribe of Reuben
For the tribe of Simeon
For the tribe of Judah
For the tribe of Issachar
For the tribe of Ephraim
For the tribe of Benjamin
For the tribe of Zebulun
For the tribe of Joseph
For the tribe of Dan
For the tribe of Asher
For the tribe of Naphtali
For the tribe of Gad
These `are' the names of the men whom Moses hath sent to spy the land; and Moses calleth Hoshea son of Nun
And Moses sendeth them to spy the land of Canaan
and have seen the land what it `is'
and what the land `is' in which it is dwelling
And what the land `is'
And they go up and spy the land
and they go up by the south
and they come in unto the brook of Eshcol
That place hath `one' called Brook of Eshcol
And they turn back from spying the land at the end of forty days."
And they go and come in unto Moses
And they recount to him
only
Amalek is dwelling in the land of the south
And Caleb stilleth the people concerning Moses
And the men who have gone up with him said
and they bring out an evil account of the land which they have spied unto the sons of Israel
and there we saw the Nephilim
