And the sons of Israel come in
And there hath been no water for the company
and the people strive with Moses
and why have ye brought in the assembly of Jehovah unto this wilderness to die there
and why hast thou brought us up out of Egypt to bring us in unto this evil place? no place of seed
And Moses and Aaron go in from the presence of the assembly unto the opening of the tent of meeting
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Take the rod
And Moses taketh the rod from before Jehovah
and Moses and Aaron assemble the assembly unto the front of the rock
and Moses lifteth up his hand
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
These `are' waters of Meribah
And Moses sendeth messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom
that our fathers go down to Egypt
and we cry unto Jehovah
Let us pass over
And Edom saith unto him
And the sons of Israel say unto him
And he saith
and Edom refuseth to suffer Israel to pass over through his border
And the sons of Israel
and Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron in mount Hor
`Aaron is gathered unto his people
`Take Aaron and Eleazar his son
and strip Aaron of his garments
And Moses doth as Jehovah hath commanded
and Moses strippeth Aaron of his garments
and all the company see that Aaron hath expired
