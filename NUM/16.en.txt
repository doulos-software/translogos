And Korah
and they rise up before Moses
and they are assembled against Moses and against Aaron
And Moses heareth
and he speaketh unto Korah
This do: take to yourselves censers
and put in them fire
And Moses saith unto Korah
is it little to you that the God of Israel hath separated you from the company of Israel to bring you near unto Himself
yea
Therefore
And Moses sendeth to call for Dathan and for Abiram sons of Eliab
is it little that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to put us to death in a wilderness that thou also certainly makest thyself prince over us?"
Yea
And it is very displeasing to Moses
And Moses saith unto Korah
and take ye each his censer
And they take each his censer
And Korah assembleth against them all the company unto the opening of the tent of meeting
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron
`Be ye separated from the midst of this company
and they fall on their faces
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the company
And Moses riseth
and he speaketh unto the company
And they go up from the tabernacle of Korah
And Moses saith
if according to the death of all men these die -- or the charge of all men is charged upon them -- Jehovah hath not sent me;"
and if a strange thing Jehovah do
And it cometh to pass at his finishing speaking all these words
and the earth openeth her mouth
and they go down
and all Israel who `are' round about them have fled at their voice
and fire hath come out from Jehovah
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Say unto Eleazar son of Aaron the priest
`even' the censers of these sinners against their own souls; and they have made them spread-out plates
And Eleazar the priest taketh the brazen censers which they who are burnt had brought near
a memorial to the sons of Israel
And all the company of the sons of Israel murmur
And it cometh to pass
and Moses cometh -- Aaron also -- unto the front of the tent of meeting."
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Get you up from the midst of this company
and Moses saith unto Aaron
And Aaron taketh as Moses hath spoken
and standeth between the dead and the living
and those who die by the plague are fourteen thousand and seven hundred
and Aaron turneth back unto Moses
