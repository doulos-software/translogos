And Balaam saith unto Balak
And Balak doth as Balaam hath spoken
and Balaam saith to Balak
And God cometh unto Balaam
and Jehovah putteth a word in the mouth of Balaam
And he turneth back unto him
And he taketh up his simile
What -- do I pierce? -- God hath not pierced! And what -- am I indignant? -- Jehovah hath not been indignant!"
For from the top of rocks I see it
Who hath counted the dust of Jacob
And Balak saith unto Balaam
and he answereth and saith
And Balak saith unto him
and he taketh him `to' the field of Zophim
And he saith unto Balak
and Jehovah cometh unto Balaam
And he cometh unto him
And he taketh up his simile
God `is' not a man -- and lieth
Lo
He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob
God is bringing them out from Egypt
For no enchantment `is' against Jacob
Lo
And Balak saith unto Balaam
and Balaam answereth and saith unto Balak
And Balak saith unto Balaam
And Balak taketh Balaam to the top of Peor
and Balaam saith unto Balak
and Balak doth as Balaam said
