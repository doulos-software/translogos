And much cattle hath been to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad
and the sons of Gad
`Ataroth
the land which Jehovah hath smitten before the company of Israel
And they say
And Moses saith to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben
and why discourage ye the heart of the sons of Israel from passing over unto the land which Jehovah hath given to them?"
`Thus did your fathers in my sending them from Kadesh-Barnea to see the land;"
and they go up unto the valley of Eshcol
and the anger of Jehovah burneth in that day
They do not see -- the men who are coming up out of Egypt from a son of twenty years and upward -- the ground which I have sworn to Abraham
save Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenezite
and the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel
`And lo
when ye turn back from after Him
And they come nigh unto him
and we -- we are armed hasting before the sons of Israel till that we have brought them in unto their place; and our infants have dwelt in the cities of defence because of the inhabitants of the land;"
we do not turn back unto our houses till the sons of Israel have inherited each his inheritance
for we do not inherit with them beyond the Jordan and yonder
And Moses saith unto them
and every armed one of you hath passed over the Jordan before Jehovah
and the land hath been subdued before Jehovah -- then afterwards ye do turn back
`And if ye do not so
build for yourselves cities for your infants
And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben speak unto Moses
our infants
and thy servants pass over
And Moses commandeth concerning them Eleazar the priest
and Moses saith unto them
and if they do not pass over armed with you
And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answer
we -- we pass over armed before Jehovah `to' the land of Canaan
And Moses giveth to them
And the sons of Gad build Dihon
and Atroth
and Beth-Nimrah
And the sons of Reuben have build Heshbon
and Nebo
And sons of Machir son of Manasseh go to Gilead
and Moses giveth Gilead to Machir son of Manasseh
And Jair son of Manasseh hath gone and captureth their towns
and Nobah hath gone and captureth Kenath
