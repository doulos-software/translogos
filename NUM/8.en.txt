And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto Aaron
And Aaron doth so; over-against the face of the candlestick he hath caused its lights to go up
And this `is' the work of the candlestick: beaten work of gold; unto its thigh
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Take the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel
`And thus thou dost to them to cleanse them: sprinkle upon them waters of atonement
and have taken a bullock
and thou hast brought near the Levites before the tent of meeting
and thou hast brought near the Levites before Jehovah
and Aaron hath waved the Levites -- a wave-offering before Jehovah
`And the Levites lay their hands on the head of the bullocks
and thou hast caused the Levites to stand before Aaron
and thou hast separated the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel
and afterwards do the Levites come in to serve the tent of meeting
`For they are certainly given to Me out of the midst of the sons of Israel
for Mine `is' every first-born among the sons of Israel
and I take the Levites instead of every first-born among the sons of Israel:"
`And I give the Levites gifts to Aaron and to his sons
And Moses doth -- Aaron also
And the Levites cleanse themselves
and afterwards have the Levites gone in to do their service in the tent of meeting
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`This `is' that which `is' the Levites': from a son of five and twenty years and upward he doth go in to serve the host in the service of the tent of meeting
and from a son of fifty years he doth return from the host of the service
and he hath ministered with his brethren in the tent of meeting
