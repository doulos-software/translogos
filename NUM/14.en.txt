And all the company lifteth up and give forth their voice
and all the sons of Israel murmur against Moses
and why is Jehovah bringing us in unto this land to fall by the sword? our wives and our infants are become a prey; is it not good for us to turn back to Egypt?'"
And they say one unto another
And Moses falleth -- Aaron also -- on their faces
And Joshua son of Nun
and they speak unto all the company of the sons of Israel
if Jehovah hath delighted in us
only
And all the company say to stone them with stones
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
I smite it with pestilence
And Moses saith unto Jehovah
and they have said `it' unto the inhabitant of this land
`And Thou hast put to death this people as one man
From Jehovah's want of ability to bring in this people unto the land which He hath sworn to them -- He doth slaughter them in the wilderness."
`And now
Jehovah `is' slow to anger
forgive
And Jehovah saith
and yet
for all the men who are seeing My honour
they see not the land which I have sworn to their fathers
and My servant Caleb
`And the Amalekite and the Canaanite are dwelling in the valley; to-morrow turn ye and journey for yourselves into the wilderness -- the way of the Red Sea.'"
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Until when hath this evil company that which they are murmuring against Me? the murmurings of the sons of Israel
say unto them
in this wilderness do your carcases fall
ye -- ye come not in unto the land which I have lifted up My hand to cause you to tabernacle in it
`As to your infants -- of whom ye have said
as to you -- your carcases do fall in this wilderness
and your sons are evil in the wilderness forty years
by the number of the days `in' which ye spied the land
I `am' Jehovah
And the men whom Moses hath sent to spy the land
even the men bringing out an evil account of the land die by the plague before Jehovah;"
and Joshua son of Nun
And Moses speaketh these words unto all the sons of Israel
and they rise early in the morning
And Moses saith
go not up
for the Amalekite and the Canaanite `are' there before you
And they presume to go up unto the top of the mountain
And the Amalekite and the Canaanite who are dwelling in that mountain come down and smite them
