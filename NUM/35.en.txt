And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Command the sons of Israel
And the cities have been to them to inhabit
`And the suburbs of the cities which ye give to the Levites `are'
And ye have measured from the outside of the city
`And the cities which ye give to the Levites `are' the six cities of refuge
all the cities which ye give to the Levites `are' forty and eight cities
And the cities which ye give `are' of the possession of the sons of Israel
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
and have prepared to yourselves cities -- cities of refuge they are to you -- then fled thither hath a man-slayer
and the cities have been to you for a refuge from the redeemer
`As to the cities which ye give -- six `are' cities of refuge to you;"
the three of the cities ye give beyond the Jordan
To sons of Israel
`And if with an instrument of iron he hath smitten him
`And if with a stone `in' the hand
`Or with a wooden instrument `in' the hand
`The redeemer of blood himself doth put the murderer to death; in his coming against him he doth put him to death."
`And if in hatred he thrust him through
or in enmity he hath smitten him with his hand
`And if
or with any stone wherewith he dieth
then have the company judged between the smiter and the redeemer of blood
`And the company have delivered the man-slayer out of the hand of the redeemer of blood
`And if the man-slayer at all go out `from' the border of the city of his refuge whither he fleeth
and the redeemer of blood hath found him at the outside of the border of the city of his refuge
for in the city of his refuge he doth dwell till the death of the chief priest; and after the death of the chief priest doth the man-slayer turn back unto the city of his possession."
`And these things have been to you for a statute of judgment to your generations
whoso smiteth a person
`And ye take no atonement for the life of a murderer who `is' condemned -- to die
and ye take no atonement for him to flee unto the city of his refuge
`And ye profane not the land which ye `are' in
and ye defile not the land in which ye are dwelling
