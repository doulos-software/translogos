And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Make to thee two trumpets of silver; beaten work thou dost make them
and they have blown with them
And if with one they blow
`And ye have blown -- a shout
`And ye have blown -- a second shout
`And in the assembling of the assembly ye blow
and sons of Aaron
`And when ye go into battle in your land against the adversary who is distressing you
`And in the day of your gladness
And it cometh to pass -- in the second year
and the sons of Israel journey in their journeyings from the wilderness of Sinai
and they journey at first
And the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah journeyeth in the first `place'
And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Issachar `is' Nathaneel son of Zuar."
And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun `is' Eliab son of Helon;"
And the tabernacle hath been taken down
And the standard of the camp of Reuben hath journeyed
And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Simeon `is' Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai."
And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Gad `is' Eliasaph son of Deuel;"
And the Kohathites have journeyed
And the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim hath journeyed
And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh `is' Gamalial son of Pedahzur."
And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin `is' Abidan son of Gideoni."
And the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan hath journeyed (rearward to all the camps)
And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Asher `is' Pagiel son of Ocran."
And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali `is' Ahira son of Enan."
These `are' journeyings of the sons of Israel by their hosts -- and they journey."
And Moses saith to Hobab son of Raguel the Midianite
And he saith unto him
And he saith
and it hath come to pass when thou goest with us
And they journey from the mount of Jehovah a journey of three days; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah is journeying before them the journey of three days
and the cloud of Jehovah `is' on them by day
And it cometh to pass in the journeying of the ark
And in its resting he saith
