And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Command the sons of Israel
then hath the south quarter been to you from the wilderness of Zin
and the border hath turned round to you from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim
and the border hath turned round from Azmon to the brook of Egypt
`As to the west border
`And this is to you the north border: from the great sea ye mark out for yourselves mount Hor;"
from mount Hor ye mark out to go in to Hamath
and the border hath gone out to Ziphron
`And ye have marked out for yourselves for the border eastward
and the border hath gone down from Shepham to Riblah
and the border hath gone down to the Jordan
And Moses commandeth the sons of Israel
for the tribe of the sons of Reuben have received
the two tribes and the half of the tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`These `are' the names of the men who give to you the inheritance of the land: Eleazar the priest
and one prince -- one prince -- for a tribe ye do take to give the land by inheritance."
`And these `are' the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah
and of the tribe of the sons of Simeon
of the tribe of Benjamin
and of the tribe of the sons of Dan
of the sons of Joseph
and of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim
and of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun
and of the tribe of the sons of Issachar
and of the tribe of the sons of Asher
and of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali
These `are' those whom Jehovah hath commanded to give the sons of Israel inheritance in the land of Canaan."
