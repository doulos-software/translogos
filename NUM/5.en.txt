And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Command the sons of Israel
from male unto female ye do send out; unto the outside of the camp ye do send them; and they defile not their camps in the midst of which I do tabernacle.'"
And the sons of Israel do so
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
and they have confessed their sin which they have done
`And if the man have no redeemer to restore the guilt to
`And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the sons of Israel
and any man's hallowed things become his; that which any man giveth to the priest becometh his.'"
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
and a man hath lain with her `with' the seed of copulation
and a spirit of jealousy hath passed over him
`Then hath the man brought in his wife unto the priest
`And the priest hath brought her near
and the priest hath taken holy water in an earthen vessel
and the priest hath caused the woman to stand before Jehovah
`And the priest hath caused her to swear
and thou
(then the priest hath caused the woman to swear with an oath of execration
and these waters which cause the curse have gone into thy bowels
`And the priest hath written these execrations in a book
and hath caused the woman to drink the bitter waters which cause the curse
`And the priest hath taken out of the hand of the woman the present of jealousy
and the priest hath taken a handful of the present
yea
`And if the woman hath not been defiled
`This `is' the law of jealousies
or when a spirit of jealousy passeth over a man
and the man hath been acquitted from iniquity
