And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`This `is' a statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded
and ye have given it unto Eleazar the priest
`And Eleazar the priest hath taken of its blood with his finger
and `one' hath burnt the cow before his eyes; her skin
and the priest hath taken cedar wood
and the priest hath washed his garments
and he who is burning it doth wash his garments with water
`And a clean man hath gathered the ashes of the cow
and he who is gathering the ashes of the heifer hath washed his garments
`He who is coming against the dead body of any man -- is unclean seven days;"
he doth cleanse himself for it on the third day
Any one who is coming against the dead
`This `is' the law
and every open vessel which hath no covering of thread upon it is unclean."
`And every one who cometh
and they have taken for the unclean person of the ashes of the burning of the `cleansing'
and a clean person hath taken hyssop
`And the clean hath sprinkled `it' on the unclean on the third day
`And the man who is unclean
`And it hath been to them for a statute age-during
and all against which the unclean person cometh is unclean
