And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Command the sons of Israel
`And thou hast said to them
the one lamb thou preparest in the morning
and a tenth of the ephah of flour for a present
a continual burnt-offering
and its libation
`And the second lamb thou dost prepare between the evenings; as the present of the morning
`And on the sabbath-day
the burnt-offering of the sabbath in its sabbath
`And in the beginnings of your months ye bring near a burnt-offering to Jehovah: two bullocks
and three-tenth deals of flour
and a several tenth deal of flour
and their libations are a half of the hin to a bullock
and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering to Jehovah; besides the continual burnt-offering it is prepared
`And in the first month
and in the fifteenth day of this month `is' a festival
in the first day `is' an holy convocation
and ye have brought near a fire-offering
and their present
a several tenth deal thou preparest for the one lamb
and one goat
`Apart from the burnt-offering of the morning
according to these ye prepare daily
and on the seventh day a holy convocation ye have
`And in the day of the first-fruits
and ye have brought near a burnt-offering for sweet fragrance to Jehovah: two bullocks
and their present
a several tenth deal to the one lamb
one kid of the goats to make atonement for you;"
apart from the continual burnt-offering and its present ye prepare `them' (perfect ones they are for you) and their libations."
