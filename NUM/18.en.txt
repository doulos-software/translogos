And Jehovah saith unto Aaron
and also thy brethren
`And they have kept thy charge
and they have been joined unto thee
and ye have kept the charge of the sanctuary
`And I
and thou
And Jehovah speaketh unto Aaron: `And I
This is thine of the most holy things
in the holy of holies thou dost eat it; every male doth eat it; holy it is to thee."
`And this `is' thine: the heave-offering of their gift
all the best of the oil
`The first-fruits of all that `is' in their land
every devoted thing in Israel is thine
every one opening a womb of all flesh which they bring near to Jehovah
`And their ransomed ones from a son of a month
`Only
and their flesh is thine
all the heave-offerings of the holy things which the sons of Israel lift up to Jehovah I have given to thee and to thy sons
And Jehovah saith unto Aaron
and to the sons of Levi
`And the sons of Israel come no more near unto the tent of meeting
and the Levites have done the service of the tent of meeting
but the tithe of the sons of Israel which they lift up to Jehovah
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`And unto the Levites thou dost speak; and thou hast said unto them
and your heave-offering hath been reckoned to you as corn from the threshing-floor
so ye do lift up -- ye also -- the heave-offering of Jehovah from all your tithes which ye receive from the sons of Israel; and ye have given from it the heave-offering of Jehovah to Aaron the priest;"
out of all your gifts ye do lift up the whole heave-offering of Jehovah; out of all its fat
`And thou hast said unto them
and ye have eaten it in every place
and ye bear no sin for it
