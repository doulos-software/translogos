And the sons of Israel journey and encamp in the plains of Moab
And Balak son of Zippor seeth all that Israel hath done to the Amorite
and Moab is exceedingly afraid of the presence of the people
and Moab saith unto the elders of Midian
and he sendeth messengers unto Balaam son of Beor
and now
And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian go
and he saith unto them
And God cometh in unto Balaam
And Balaam saith unto God
Lo
and God saith unto Balaam
And Balaam riseth in the morning
and the princes of Moab rise
And Balak addeth yet to send princes
and they come in unto Balaam
for very greatly I honour thee
And Balaam answereth and saith unto the servants of Balak
and
And God cometh in unto Balaam
And Balaam riseth in the morning
and the anger of God burneth because he is going
and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way
And the messenger of Jehovah standeth in a narrow path of the vineyards -- a wall on this `side' and a wall on that --"
and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah
and the messenger of Jehovah addeth to pass over
and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah
And Jehovah openeth the mouth of the ass
and Balaam saith to the ass
and the ass saith unto Balaam
And Jehovah uncovereth the eyes of Balaam
and the messenger of Jehovah saith unto him
and the ass seeth me
And Balaam saith unto the messenger of Jehovah
And the messenger of Jehovah saith unto Balaam
And Balak heareth that Balaam hath come
and Balak saith unto Balaam
And Balaam saith unto Balak
And Balaam goeth with Balak
and Balak sacrificeth oxen and sheep
and it cometh to pass in the morning
