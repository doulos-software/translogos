And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto the sons of Israel
from wine and strong drink he doth keep separate; vinegar of wine
all days of his separation
`All days of the vow of his separation a razor doth not pass over his head; till the fulness of the days which he doth separate to Jehovah he is holy; grown up hath the upper part of the hair of his head."
`All days of his keeping separate to Jehovah
for his father
all days of his separation he `is' holy to Jehovah."
`And when the dead dieth beside him in an instant
and on the eighth day he bringeth in two turtle-doves or two young pigeons unto the priest
and the priest hath prepared one for a sin-offering
and he hath separated to Jehovah the days of his separation
`And this `is' the law of the Nazarite; in the day of the fulness of the days of his separation doth `one' bring him in unto the opening of the tent of meeting
and he hath brought near his offering to Jehovah
and a basket of unleavened things of flour
`And the priest hath brought `them' near before Jehovah
and the ram he maketh a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Jehovah
`And the Nazarite hath shaved (at the opening of the tent of meeting) the head of his separation
`And the priest hath taken the boiled shoulder from the ram
and the priest hath waved them
`This `is' the law of the Nazarite
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Speak unto Aaron
`Jehovah bless thee and keep thee;"
`Jehovah cause His face to shine upon thee
`Jehovah lift up His countenance upon thee
`And they have put My name upon the sons of Israel
