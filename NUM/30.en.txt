And Moses speaketh unto the heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel
`When a man voweth a vow to Jehovah
`And when a woman voweth a vow to Jehovah
and her father hath heard her vow
`And if her father hath disallowed her in the day of his hearing
`And if she be at all to a husband
and her husband hath heard
`And if in the day of her husband's hearing he disalloweth her
`As to the vow of a widow or cast-out woman
`And if `in' the house of her husband she hath vowed
and her husband hath heard
`And if her husband doth certainly break them in the day of his hearing
`Every vow and every oath -- a bond to humble a soul -- her husband doth establish it
and if her husband certainly keep silent at her
and if he doth at all break them after his hearing
These `are' the statutes which Jehovah hath commanded Moses between a man and his wife
