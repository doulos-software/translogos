And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Take up the sum of the sons of Kohath from the midst of the sons of Levi
from a son of thirty years and upward
`This `is' the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting
that Aaron and his sons have come in
and have put on it a covering of badger skin
`And on the table of the presence they spread a garment of blue
and they have spread over them a garment of scarlet
and have taken a garment of blue
and they have put it and all its vessels unto a covering of badger skin
`And on the golden altar they spread a garment of blue
and have taken all the vessels of ministry wherewith they minister in the sanctuary
and have removed the ashes of the altar
and have put on it all its vessels wherewith they minister about it
`And Aaron hath finished -- his sons also -- covering the sanctuary
`And the oversight of Eleazar
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron
`Ye do not cut off the tribe of the families of the Kohathite from the midst of the Levites;"
but this do to them
and they go not in to see when the holy thing is swallowed
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Take up the sum of the sons of Gershon also by the house of their fathers
from a son of thirty years and upward
`This `is' the service of the families of the Gershonite
and they have borne the curtains of the tabernacle
and the hangings of the court
`By the command of Aaron and his sons is all the service of the sons of the Gershonite in all their burden
This `is' the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonite in the tent of meeting; and their charge `is' under the hand of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest."
`The sons of Merari
from a son of thirty years and upward even unto a son of fifty years thou dost number them
`And this `is' the charge of their burden
and the pillars of the court round about
`This `is' the service of the families of the sons of Merari
And Moses numbereth -- Aaron also
from a son of thirty years and upward even unto a son of fifty years
and their numbered ones
These `are' those numbered of the families of the Kohathite
And those numbered of the sons of Gershon
from a son of thirty years and upward even unto a son of fifty years
even their numbered ones
These `are' those numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon
And those numbered of the families of the sons of Merari
from a son of thirty years and upward even unto a son of fifty years
even their numbered ones
These `are' those numbered of the families of the sons of Merari
All those numbered
from a son of thirty years and upward even unto a son of fifty years
even their numbered ones are eight thousand and five hundred and eighty;"
by the command of Jehovah hath `one' numbered them
