Blow ye a trumpet in Zion
A day of darkness and thick darkness
Before it consumed hath fire
As the appearance of horses `is' its appearance
As the noise of chariots
From its face pained are peoples
As mighty ones they run
And each his brother they press not
In the city they run to and fro
At their face trembled hath the earth
And Jehovah hath given forth His voice before His force
And also now -- an affirmation of Jehovah
And rend your heart
Who knoweth -- He doth turn back
Blow ye a trumpet in Zion
Gather the people
Between the porch and the altar weep let the priests
And let Jehovah be zealous for His land
Let Jehovah answer and say to His people
And the northern I put far off from you
Do not fear
Do not fear
And ye sons of Zion
And full have been the floors `with' pure corn
And I have recompensed to you the years That consume did the locust
And ye have eaten
And ye have known that in the midst of Israel `am' I
And it hath come to pass afterwards
And also on the men-servants
And I have given wonders in the heavens
The sun is turned to darkness
And it hath come to pass
