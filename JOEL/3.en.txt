For lo
Then I have gathered all the nations
And for My people they do cast a lot
And also
In that My silver and My gold ye took
And sons of Judah
Lo
And have sold your sons and your daughters Into the hand of the sons of Judah
Proclaim ye this among nations
Beat your ploughshares to swords
Haste
Wake and come up let the nations unto the valley of Jehoshaphat
Send ye forth a sickle
Multitudes
Sun and moon have been black
And Jehovah from Zion doth roar
And ye have known that I `am' Jehovah your God
And it hath come to pass
Egypt a desolation becometh
And Judah to the age doth dwell
And I have declared their blood innocent
