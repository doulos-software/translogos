A word of Jehovah that hath been unto Joel
Hear this
Concerning it to your sons talk ye
What is left of the palmer-worm
Awake
For a nation hath come up on my land
It hath made my vine become a desolation
Wail
Cut off hath been present and libation from the house of Jehovah
Spoiled is the field
Be ashamed
The vine hath been dried up
Gird
Sanctify a fast
And cry unto Jehovah
Is not before our eyes food cut off? From the house of our God joy and rejoicing?"
Rotted have scattered things under their clods
How have cattle sighed! Perplexed have been droves of oxen
Unto Thee
Also the cattle of the field long for Thee
