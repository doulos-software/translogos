As to the rest
for ye have known what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus
for this is the will of God -- your sanctification; that ye abstain from the whoredom
that each of you know his own vessel to possess in sanctification and honour
not in the affection of desire
that no one go beyond and defraud in the matter his brother
for God did not call us on uncleanness
he
And concerning the brotherly love
for ye do it also to all the brethren who `are' in all Macedonia; and we call upon you
and to study to be quiet
that ye may walk becomingly unto those without
And I do not wish you to be ignorant
for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again
for this to you we say in the word of the Lord
because the Lord himself
then we who are living
so
