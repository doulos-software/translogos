Paul
We give thanks to God always for you all
unceasingly remembering of you the work of the faith
having known
because our good news did not come to you in word only
and ye -- ye did become imitators of us
so that ye became patterns to all those believing in Macedonia and Achaia
for from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord
for they themselves concerning us do declare what entrance we had unto you
and to wait for His Son from the heavens
