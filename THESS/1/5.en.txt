And concerning the times and the seasons
for yourselves have known thoroughly that the day of the Lord as a thief in the night doth so come
for when they may say
and ye
all ye are sons of light
so
for those sleeping
and we
because God did not appoint us to anger
who did die for us
wherefore
And we ask you
and to esteem them very abundantly in love
and we exhort you
see no one evil for evil may render to any one
always rejoice ye;"
continually pray ye;"
in every thing give thanks
The Spirit quench not;"
prophesyings despise not;"
all things prove; that which is good hold fast;"
from all appearance of evil abstain ye;"
and the God of the peace Himself sanctify you wholly
stedfast is He who is calling you
Brethren
salute all the brethren in an holy kiss;"
I charge you `by' the Lord
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ `is' with you! Amen."
