Wherefore no longer forbearing
and did send Timotheus -- our brother
that no one be moved in these tribulations
for even when we were with you
because of this also
And now Timotheus having come unto us from you
because of this we were comforted
because now we live
for what thanks are we able to recompense to God for you
night and day exceedingly beseeching
And our God and Father Himself
and you the Lord cause to increase and to abound in the love to one another
to the establishing your hearts blameless in sanctification before our God and Father
