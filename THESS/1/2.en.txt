For yourselves have known
but having both suffered before
for our exhortation `is' not out of deceit
but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the good news
for at no time did we come with speech of flattery
nor seeking of men glory
But we became gentle in your midst
so being desirous of you
for ye remember
ye `are' witnesses -- God also -- how kindly and righteously
even as ye have known
for your walking worthily of God
Because of this also
for ye became imitators
who did both put to death the Lord Jesus and their own prophets
forbidding us to speak to the nations that they might be saved
And we
wherefore we wished to come unto you
for what `is' our hope
for ye are our glory and joy."
