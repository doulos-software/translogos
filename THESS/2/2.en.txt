And we ask you
that ye be not quickly shaken in mind
let not any one deceive you in any manner
who is opposing and is raising himself up above all called God or worshipped
Do ye not remember that
and now
for the secret of the lawlessness doth already work
and then shall be revealed the Lawless One
`him
and in all deceitfulness of the unrighteousness in those perishing
and because of this shall God send to them a working of delusion
that they may be judged -- all who did not believe the truth
And we -- we ought to give thanks to God always for you
to which He did call you through our good news
so
and may our Lord Jesus Christ himself
comfort your hearts
