As to the rest
and that we may be delivered from the unreasonable and evil men
and stedfast is the Lord
and we have confidence in the Lord touching you
and the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God
And we command you
for yourselves have known how it behoveth `you' to imitate us
nor for nought did we eat bread of any one
not because we have not authority
for even when we were with you
for we hear of certain walking among you disorderly
and such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ
and ye
and if any one do not obey our word through the letter
and as an enemy count `him' not
and may the Lord of the peace Himself give to you the peace always in every way; the Lord `is' with you all!"
The salutation by the hand of me
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ `is' with you all! Amen."
