Paul
Grace to you
We ought to give thanks to God always for you
so that we ourselves do glory in you in the assemblies of God
a token of the righteous judgment of God
since `it is' a righteous thing with God to give back to those troubling you -- trouble
and to you who are troubled -- rest with us in the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven
in flaming fire
who shall suffer justice -- destruction age-during -- from the face of the Lord
when He may come to be glorified in his saints
for which also we do pray always for you
that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you
