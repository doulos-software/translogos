`And it hath been
that thou hast taken of the first of all the fruits of the ground which thou dost bring in out of thy land which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee
`And thou hast come in unto the priest who is in those days
and the priest hath taken the basket out of thy hand
`And thou hast answered and said before Jehovah thy God
and the Egyptians do us evil
and we cry unto Jehovah
and Jehovah bringeth us out from Egypt
and he bringeth us in unto this place
`And now
and rejoiced in all the good which Jehovah thy God hath given to thee
`When thou dost complete to tithe all the tithe of thine increase in the third year
and thou hast said before Jehovah thy God
I have not eaten in mine affliction of it
look from Thy holy habitation
`This day Jehovah thy God is commanding thee to do these statutes and judgments; and thou hast hearkened and done them with all thy heart
Jehovah thou hast caused to promise to-day to become thy God
`And Jehovah hath caused thee to promise to-day to become His people
so as to make thee uppermost above all the nations whom He hath made for a praise
