`Observe the month of Abib -- and thou hast made a passover to Jehovah thy God
and thou hast sacrificed a passover to Jehovah thy God
`Thou dost not eat with it any fermented thing
and there is not seen with thee leaven in all thy border seven days
`Thou art not able to sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee
except at the place which Jehovah thy God doth choose to cause His name to tabernacle -- there thou dost sacrifice the passover in the evening
and thou hast cooked and eaten in the place on which Jehovah thy God doth fix
six days thou dost eat unleavened things
`Seven weeks thou dost number to thee; from the beginning of the sickle among the standing corn thou dost begin to number seven weeks
and thou hast made the feast of weeks to Jehovah thy God
And thou hast rejoiced before Jehovah thy God
and thou hast remembered that a servant thou hast been in Egypt
`The feast of booths thou dost make for thee seven days
and thou hast rejoiced in thy feast
Seven days thou dost feast before Jehovah thy God
`Three times in a year doth every one of thy males appear before Jehovah thy God in the place which He doth choose -- in the feast of unleavened things
each according to the gift of his hand
`Judges and authorities thou dost make to thee within all thy gates which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee
Thou dost not turn aside judgment; thou dost not discern faces
Righteousness -- righteousness thou dost pursue
`Thou dost not plant for thee a shrine of any trees near the altar of Jehovah thy God
and thou dost not raise up to thee any standing image which Jehovah thy God is hating."
