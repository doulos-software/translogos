`And Moses -- the elders of Israel also -- commandeth the people
and it hath been
and written on them all the words of this law in thy passing over
`And it hath been
and built there an altar to Jehovah thy God
Of complete stones thou buildest the altar of Jehovah thy God
and sacrificed peace-offerings
and written on the stones all the words of this law
And Moses speaketh -- the priests
and thou hast hearkened to the voice of Jehovah thy God
And Moses commandeth the people on that day
`These do stand
And these do stand
`And the Levites have answered and said unto every man of Israel -- a loud voice:"
`Cursed `is' the man who maketh a graven and molten image
`Cursed `is' He who is making light of his father and his mother
`Cursed `is' he who is removing his neighbour's border
`Cursed `is' he who is causing the blind to err in the way
`Cursed `is' he who is turning aside the judgment of fatherless
`Cursed `is' he who is lying with his father's wife
`Cursed `is' he who is lying with any beast
`Cursed `is' he who is lying with his sister
`Cursed `is' he who is lying with his mother-in-law
`Cursed `is' he who is smiting his neighbour in secret
`Cursed `is' he who is taking a bribe to smite a person
`Cursed `is' he who doth not establish the words of this law
