And Moses goeth up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo
and all Naphtali
and the south
And Jehovah saith unto him
And Moses
and He burieth him in a valley in the land of Moab
And Moses `is' a son of a hundred and twenty years when he dieth; his eye hath not become dim
And the sons of Israel bewail Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; and the days of weeping `and' mourning for Moses are completed."
And Joshua son of Nun is full of the spirit of wisdom
And there hath not arisen a prophet any more in Israel like Moses
in reference to all the signs and the wonders which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt
and in reference to all the strong hand
