And Moses goeth and speaketh these words unto all Israel
and he saith unto them
`Jehovah thy God He is passing over before thee
and Jehovah hath done to them as he hath done to Sihon and to Og
And Jehovah hath given them before your face
be strong and courageous
And Moses calleth for Joshua
and Jehovah `is' He who is going before thee
And Moses writeth this law
and Moses commandeth them
in the coming in of all Israel to see the face of Jehovah in the place which He chooseth
`Assemble the people
and their sons
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and Jehovah is seen in the tent
And Jehovah saith unto Moses
and Mine anger hath burned against it in that day
and I certainly hide My face in that day for all the evil which it hath done
`And now
and I bring them in unto the ground which I have sworn to their fathers -- flowing with milk and honey
`And it hath been
And Moses writeth this song on that day
and He commandeth Joshua son of Nun
And it cometh to pass
that Moses commandeth the Levites bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah
`Take this Book of the Law
for I -- I have known thy rebellion
`Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes
for I have known that after my death ye do very corruptly
And Moses speaketh in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song
