`Give ear
Drop as rain doth My doctrine; Flow as dew doth My sayings; As storms on the tender grass
For the Name of Jehovah I proclaim
The Rock! -- perfect `is' His work
It hath done corruptly to Him; Their blemish is not His sons'
To Jehovah do ye act thus
Remember days of old -- Understand the years of many generations -- Ask thy father
In the Most High causing nations to inherit
For Jehovah's portion `is' His people
He findeth him in a land -- a desert
As an eagle waketh up its nest
Jehovah alone doth lead him
He maketh him ride on high places of earth
Butter of the herd
And Jeshurun waxeth fat
They make Him zealous with strangers
They sacrifice to demons -- no god! Gods they have not known -- New ones -- from the vicinity they came; Not feared them have your fathers!"
The Rock that begat thee thou forgettest
And Jehovah seeth and despiseth -- For the provocation of His sons and His daughters."
And He saith: I hide My face from them
They have made Me zealous by `no-god
For a fire hath been kindled in Mine anger
I gather upon them evils
Exhausted by famine
Without bereave doth the sword
I have said: I blow them away
If not -- the anger of an enemy I fear
For a nation lost to counsels `are' they
If they were wise -- They deal wisely `with' this; They attend to their latter end:"
How doth one pursue a thousand
For not as our Rock `is' their rock
For of the vine of Sodom their vine `is'
The poison of dragons `is' their wine And the fierce venom of asps."
Is it not laid up with Me? Sealed among My treasures?"
Mine `are' vengeance and recompense
For Jehovah doth judge His people
And He hath said
Which the fat of their sacrifices do eat
See ye
For I lift up unto the heavens My hand
If I have sharpened the brightness of My sword
I make drunk Mine arrows with blood
Sing ye nations -- `with' his people
And Moses cometh and speaketh all the words of this song in the ears of the people
and Moses finisheth to speak all these words unto all Israel
and saith unto them
for it `is' not a vain thing for you
And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses
`Go up unto this mount Abarim
and die in the mount whither thou art going up
`Because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribath-Kadesh
but over-against thou seest the land
