`When thou goest out to battle against thine enemy
and it hath been
and said unto them
for Jehovah your God `is' He who is going with you
`And the authorities have spoken unto the people
`And who `is' the man that hath planted a vineyard
`And who `is' the man that hath betrothed a woman
`And the authorities have added to speak unto the people
and it hath come to pass as the authorities finish to speak unto the people
`When thou drawest near unto a city to fight against it
and it hath been
`And if it doth not make peace with thee
and Jehovah thy God hath given it into thy hand
Only
So thou dost do to all the cities which are very far off from thee
`Only
for thou dost certainly devote the Hittite
so that they teach you not to do according to all their abominations which they have done to their gods
`When thou layest siege unto a city many days
Only
