`And thou hast loved Jehovah thy God
and ye have known to-day -- for it is not your sons who have not known
and His signs
and that which He hath done to the force of Egypt
and that which He hath done to you in the wilderness
and that which He hath done to Dathan
`-- But `it is' your eyes which are seeing all the great work of Jehovah
and ye have kept all the command which I am commanding thee to-day
and so that ye prolong days on the ground which Jehovah hath sworn to your fathers to give to them and to their seed -- a land flowing with milk and honey."
`For the land whither thou art going in to possess it
but the land whither ye are passing over to possess it
a land which Jehovah thy God is searching; continually `are' the eyes of Jehovah thy God upon it
`And it hath been -- if thou hearken diligently unto My commands which I am commanding you to-day
that I have given the rain of your land in its season -- sprinkling and gathered -- and thou hast gathered thy corn
and I have given herbs in thy field for thy cattle
`Take heed to yourselves
and the anger of Jehovah hath burned against you
`And ye have placed these my words on your heart
and ye have taught them to your sons
and hast written them on the side-posts of thy house
so that your days are multiplied
`For
then hath Jehovah dispossessed all these nations from before you
every place on which the sole of your foot treadeth is yours; from the wilderness
no man doth station himself in your presence; your dread and your fear doth Jehovah your God put on the face of all the land on which ye tread
`See
the blessing
and the reviling
`And it hath been
are they not beyond the Jordan
for ye are passing over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you; and ye have possessed it
and observed to do all the statutes and the judgments which I am setting before you to day."
