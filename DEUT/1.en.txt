These `are' the words which Moses hath spoken unto all Israel
eleven days' from Horeb
And it cometh to pass in the fortieth year
after his smiting Sihon king of the Amorite who is dwelling in Heshbon
beyond the Jordan
`Jehovah our God hath spoken unto us in Horeb
turn ye and journey for you
see
`And I speak unto you at that time
Jehovah your God hath multiplied you
Jehovah
`How do I bear by myself your pressure
Give for yourselves men
and ye answer me and say
`And I take the heads of your tribes
And I command your judges at that time
ye do not discern faces in judgment; as the little so the great ye do hear; ye are not afraid of the face of any
and I command you
`And we journey from Horeb
`And I say unto you
see
`And ye come near unto me
and the thing is good in mine eyes
`And they turn and go up to the hill-country
and they take with their hand of the fruit of the land
`And ye have not been willing to go up
and murmur in your tents
whither are we going up? our brethren have melted our heart
`And I say unto you
Jehovah your God
and in the wilderness
`And in this thing ye are not stedfast in Jehovah your God
who is going before you in the way to search out to you a place for your encamping
`And Jehovah heareth the voice of your words
Not one of these men of this evil generation doth see the good land which I have sworn to give to your fathers
save Caleb son of Jephunneh -- he doth see it
`Also with me hath Jehovah been angry for your sake
Joshua son of Nun
`And your infants
and ye
`And ye answer and say unto me
and Jehovah saith unto me
`And I speak unto you
and the Amorite who is dwelling in that hill-country cometh out to meet you
`And ye turn back and weep before Jehovah
and ye dwell in Kadesh many days
