`Thou dost not see the ox of thy brother or his sheep driven away
and if thy brother `is' not near unto thee
and so thou dost to his ass
`Thou dost not see the ass of thy brother
`The habiliments of a man are not on a woman
`When a bird's nest cometh before thee in the way
thou dost certainly send away the mother
`When thou buildest a new house
`Thou dost not sow thy vineyard `with' divers things
`Thou dost not plow with an ox and with an ass together."
`Thou dost not put on a mixed cloth
`Fringes thou dost make to thee on the four skirts of thy covering with which thou dost cover `thyself'."
`When a man taketh a wife
and laid against her actions of words
`Then hath the father of the damsel -- and her mother -- taken and brought out the tokens of virginity of the damsel unto the elders of the city in the gate
and the father of the damsel hath said unto the elders
and lo
`And the elders of that city have taken the man
and fined him a hundred silverlings
`And if this thing hath been truth -- tokens of virginity have not been found for the damsel --"
then they have brought out the damsel unto the opening of her father's house
`When a man is found lying with a woman
`When there is a damsel
then ye have brought them both out unto the gate of that city
`And if in a field the man find the damsel who is betrothed
and to the damsel thou dost not do anything
for in a field he found her
`When a man findeth a damsel
then hath the man who is lying with her given to the father of the damsel fifty silverlings
`A man doth not take his father's wife
