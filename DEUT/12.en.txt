`These `are' the statutes and the judgments which ye observe to do in the land which Jehovah
ye do utterly destroy all the places where the nations which ye are dispossessing served their gods
and ye have broken down their altars
`Ye do not do so to Jehovah your God;"
but unto the place which Jehovah your God doth choose out of all your tribes to put His name there
and hast brought in thither your burnt-offerings
and ye have eaten there before Jehovah your God
`Ye do not do according to all that we are doing here to-day
for ye have not come in hitherto unto the rest
and ye have passed over the Jordan
`And it hath been
and ye have rejoiced before Jehovah your God
`Take heed to thee
except in the place which Jehovah doth choose in one of thy tribes
`Only
`Only
thou art not able to eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn
but before Jehovah thy God thou dost eat it
take heed to thee lest thou forsake the Levite all thy days on thy ground."
`When Jehovah thy God doth enlarge thy border
`When the place is far from thee which Jehovah thy God doth choose to put His name there
only
`Only
thou dost not eat it
thou dost not eat it
`Only
and thou hast made thy burnt-offerings -- the flesh and the blood -- on the altar of Jehovah thy God; and the blood of thy sacrifices is poured out by the altar of Jehovah thy God
Observe
`When Jehovah thy God doth cut off the nations -- whither thou art going in to possess them -- from thy presence
take heed to thee
`Thou dost not do so to Jehovah thy God; for every abomination of Jehovah which He is hating they have done to their gods
The whole thing which I am commanding you -- it ye observe to do; thou dost not add unto it
