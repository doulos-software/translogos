`One wounded
a bastard doth not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even a tenth generation of him doth not enter into the assembly of Jehovah."
`An Ammonite and a Moabite doth not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even a tenth generation of them doth not enter into the assembly of Jehovah -- to the age;"
because that they have not come before you with bread and with water in the way
and Jehovah thy God hath not been willing to hearken unto Balaam
thou dost not seek their peace and their good all thy days -- to the age."
`Thou dost not abominate an Edomite
sons who are begotten of them
`When a camp goeth out against thine enemies
`When there is in thee a man who is not clean
and it hath been
`And a station thou hast at the outside of the camp
and a nail thou hast on thy staff
for Jehovah thy God is walking up and down in the midst of thy camp
`Thou dost not shut up a servant unto his lord
with thee he doth dwell
`There is not a whore among the daughters of Israel
thou dost not bring a gift of a whore
`Thou dost not lend in usury to thy brother; usury of money
To a stranger thou mayest lend in usury
`When thou vowest a vow to Jehovah thy God
`And when thou forbearest to vow
The produce of thy lips thou dost keep
`When thou comest in unto the vineyard of thy neighbour
When thou comest in among the standing-corn of thy neighbour
