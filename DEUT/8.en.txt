`All the command which I am commanding thee to-day ye observe to do
and thou hast remembered all the way which Jehovah thy God hath caused thee to go these forty years in the wilderness
`And He doth humble thee
`Thy raiment hath not worn out from off thee
and thou hast known
and thou hast kept the commands of Jehovah thy God
`For Jehovah thy God is bringing thee in unto a good land
a land of wheat
a land in which without scarcity thou dost eat bread
and thou hast eaten
`Take heed to thyself
lest thou eat
and thy herd and thy flock be multiplied
`And thy heart hath been high
who is causing thee to go in the great and the terrible wilderness -- burning serpent
who is causing thee to eat manna in the wilderness
and thou hast said in thy heart
`And thou hast remembered Jehovah thy God
`And it hath been -- if thou really forget Jehovah thy God
as the nations whom Jehovah is destroying from your presence
