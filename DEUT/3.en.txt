`And we turn
`And Jehovah saith unto me
`And Jehovah our God giveth into our hands also Og king of Bashan
and we capture all his cities at that time
All these `are' cities fenced with high walls
and we devote them
and all the cattle
`And we take
(Sidonians call Hermon
all the cities of the plain
for only Og king of Bashan had been left of the remnant of the Rephaim; lo
`And this land we have possessed
and the rest of Gilead and all Bashan
`Jair son of Manasseh hath taken all the region of Argob
And to Machir I have given Gilead."
`And to the Reubenite and to the Gadite I have given from Gilead even unto the brook Arnon
and the plain
`And I command you
Only
till that Jehovah give rest to your brethren like yourselves
`And Jehoshua I have commanded at that time
fear them not
`And I entreat for grace unto Jehovah
Lord Jehovah
Let me pass over
`And Jehovah sheweth himself wroth with me
go up `to' the top of Pisgah
and charge Jehoshua
`And we dwell in a valley over-against Beth-Peor."
