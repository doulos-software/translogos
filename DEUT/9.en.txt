`Hear
a people great and tall
and thou hast known to-day
`Thou dost not speak in thy heart (in Jehovah thy God's driving them away from before thee)
not for thy righteousness
and thou hast known
`Remember -- do not forget -- that `with' which thou hast made Jehovah thy God wroth in the wilderness; even from the day that thou hast come out of the land of Egypt till your coming in unto this place rebels ye have been with Jehovah;"
even in Horeb ye have made Jehovah wroth
`In my going up into the mount to receive the tables of stone (tables of the covenant which Jehovah hath made with you)
and Jehovah giveth unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God
`And it cometh to pass
and Jehovah saith unto me
`And Jehovah speaketh unto me
desist from Me
`And I turn
and I see
`And I lay hold on the two tables
and I throw myself before Jehovah
`For I have been afraid because of the anger and the fury with which Jehovah hath been wroth against you
`And with Aaron hath Jehovah shewed himself very angry
and your sin
`And in Taberah
and in Jehovah's sending you from Kadesh-Barnea
rebels ye have been with Jehovah from the day of my knowing you."
`And I throw myself before Jehovah
and I pray unto Jehovah
be mindful of Thy servants
lest the land say from which Thou hast brought us out
and they `are' Thy people
