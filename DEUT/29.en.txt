These `are' the words of the covenant which Jehovah hath commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab
And Moses calleth unto all Israel
the great trials which thine eyes have seen
and Jehovah hath not given to you a heart to know
and I cause you to go forty years in a wilderness; your garments have not been consumed from off you
bread ye have not eaten
`And ye come in unto this place
and take their land
and ye have kept the words of this covenant
`Ye are standing to-day
your infants
for thy passing over into the covenant of Jehovah thy God
in order to establish thee to-day to Him for a people
`And not with you alone am I making this covenant and this oath;"
but with him who is here with us
for ye have known how ye dwelt in the land of Egypt
and ye see their abominations
lest there be among you a man or woman
`And it hath been
Jehovah is not willing to be propitious to him
and Jehovah hath separated him for evil
`And the latter generation of your sons who rise after you
(`with' brimstone and salt is the whole land burnt
yea
`And they have said
and they go and serve other gods
and the anger of Jehovah burneth against that land
and Jehovah doth pluck them from off their ground in anger
`The things hidden `are' to Jehovah our God
