`There is not to the priests the Levites -- all the tribe of Levi -- a portion and inheritance with Israel; fire-offerings of Jehovah
and he hath no inheritance in the midst of his brethren; Jehovah Himself `is' his inheritance
`And this is the priest's right from the people
the first of thy corn
for on him hath Jehovah thy God fixed
`And when the Levite cometh from one of thy cities out of all Israel
then he hath ministered in the name of Jehovah his God
portion as portion they do eat
`When thou art coming in unto the land which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee
there is not found in thee one causing his son and his daughter to pass over into fire
and a charmer
`For the abomination of Jehovah `is' every one doing these
Perfect thou art with Jehovah thy God
for these nations whom thou art possessing
`A prophet out of thy midst
according to all that thou didst ask from Jehovah thy God
and Jehovah saith unto me
a prophet I raise up to them
and it hath been -- the man who doth not hearken unto My words which he doth speak in My name
`Only
`And when thou sayest in thy heart
that which the prophet speaketh in the name of Jehovah
