`At the end of seven years thou dost make a release
and this `is' the matter of the release: Every owner of a loan `is' to release his hand which he doth lift up against his neighbour
of the stranger thou mayest exact
only when there is no needy one with thee
`Only
for Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee as He hath spoken to thee; and thou hast lent `to' many nations
`When there is with thee any needy one of one of thy brethren
for thou dost certainly open thy hand to him
`Take heed to thee lest there be a word in thy heart -- worthless
thou dost certainly give to him
because the needy one doth not cease out of the land
`When thy brother is sold to thee
And when thou dost send him away free from thee
thou dost certainly encircle him out of thy flock
and thou hast remembered that a servant thou hast been in the land of Egypt
`And it hath been
then thou hast taken the awl
`It is not hard in thine eyes
`Every firstling that is born in thy herd and in thy flock -- the male thou dost sanctify to Jehovah thy God; thou dost not work with the firstling of thine ox
before Jehovah thy God thou dost eat it year by year
`And when there is in it a blemish
within thy gates thou dost eat it
Only
