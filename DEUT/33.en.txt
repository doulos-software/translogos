And this `is' the blessing `with' which Moses the man of God blessed the sons of Israel before his death
and he saith: -- `Jehovah from Sinai hath come
Also He `is' loving the peoples; All His holy ones `are' in thy hand
A law hath Moses commanded us
And he is in Jeshurun king
Let Reuben live
And this `is' for Judah; and he saith: -- Hear
And of Levi he said: -- Thy Thummim and thy Urim `are' for thy pious one
Who is saying of his father and his mother
They teach Thy judgments to Jacob
Bless
Of Benjamin he said: -- The beloved of Jehovah doth tabernacle confidently by him
And of Joseph he said: -- Blessed of Jehovah `is' his land
And by precious things -- fruits of the sun
And by chief things -- of the ancient mountains
And by precious things -- of earth and its fulness
His honour `is' a firstling of his ox
And of Zebulun he said: -- Rejoice
Peoples `to' the mountain they call
And of Gad he said: -- Blessed of the Enlarger `is' Gad
And he provideth the first part for himself
And of Dan he said: -- Dan `is' a lion's whelp; he doth leap from Bashan."
And of Naphtali he said: -- O Naphtali
And of Asher he said: -- Blessed with sons `is' Asher
Iron and brass `are' thy shoes
There is none like the God of Jeshurun
A habitation `is' the eternal God
And Israel doth tabernacle `in' confidence alone; The eye of Jacob `is' unto a land of corn and wine; Also His heavens drop down dew."
O thy happiness
