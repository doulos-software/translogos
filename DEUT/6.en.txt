`And this `is' the command
so that thou dost fear Jehovah thy God
`And thou hast heard
`Hear
and thou hast loved Jehovah thy God with all thy heart
and these words which I am commanding thee to-day have been on thine heart
and thou hast repeated them to thy sons
and hast bound them for a sign upon thy hand
and thou hast written them on door-posts of thy house
`And it hath been
and houses full of all good things which thou hast not filled
`Take heed to thyself lest thou forget Jehovah who hath brought thee out of the land of Egypt
Jehovah thy God thou dost fear
ye do not go after other gods
for a zealous God `is' Jehovah thy God in thy midst -- lest the anger of Jehovah thy God burn against thee
`Ye do not try Jehovah your God as ye tried in Massah;"
ye do diligently keep the commands of Jehovah your God
and thou hast done that which is right and good in the eyes of Jehovah
to drive away all thine enemies from thy presence
`When thy son asketh thee hereafter
then thou hast said to thy son
and Jehovah giveth signs and wonders
and us He hath brought out thence
And Jehovah commandeth us to do all these statutes
and righteousness it is for us
