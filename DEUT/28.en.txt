`And it hath been
and all these blessings have come upon thee
`Blessed `art' thou in the city
`Blessed `is' the fruit of thy womb
`Blessed `is' thy basket and thy kneading-trough."
`Blessed `art' thou in thy coming in
`Jehovah giveth thine enemies
`Jehovah commandeth with thee the blessing in thy storehouses
`Jehovah doth establish thee to Himself for a holy people
and all the peoples of the land have seen that the name of Jehovah is called upon thee
`And Jehovah hath made thee abundant in good
`Jehovah doth open to thee his good treasure -- the heavens -- to give the rain of thy land in its season
`And Jehovah hath given thee for head
and thou dost not turn aside from all the words which I am commanding you to-day -- right or left -- to go after other gods
`And it hath been
`Cursed `art' thou in the city
`Cursed `is' thy basket and thy kneading-trough."
`Cursed `is' the fruit of thy body
`Cursed `art' thou in thy coming in
`Jehovah doth send on thee the curse
`Jehovah doth cause to cleave to thee the pestilence
`Jehovah doth smite thee with consumption
`And thy heavens which `are' over thy head have been brass
Jehovah giveth the rain of thy land -- dust and ashes; from the heavens it cometh down on thee till thou art destroyed."
`Jehovah giveth thee smitten before thine enemies; in one way thou goest out unto them
and thy carcase hath been for food to every fowl of the heavens
`Jehovah doth smite thee with the ulcer of Egypt
`Jehovah doth smite thee with madness
and thou hast been gropling at noon
`A woman thou dost betroth
thine ox `is' slaughtered before thine eyes
`Thy sons and thy daughters `are' given to another people
The fruit of thy ground
and thou hast been mad
`Jehovah doth smite thee with an evil ulcer
`Jehovah doth cause thee to go
and thou hast been for an astonishment
`Much seed thou dost take out into the field
vineyards thou dost plant
olives are to thee in all thy border
`Sons and daughters thou dost beget
all thy trees and the fruit of thy ground doth the locust possess;"
the sojourner who `is' in thy midst goeth up above thee very high
he doth lend `to' thee
`And come upon thee have all these curses
and they have been on thee for a sign and for a wonder
`Because that thou hast not served Jehovah thy God with joy
thou hast served thine enemies
`Jehovah doth lift up against thee a nation
a nation -- fierce of countenance -- which accepteth not the face of the aged
and it hath eaten the fruit of thy cattle
`And it hath laid siege to thee in all thy gates
and thou hast eaten the fruit of thy body
`The man who is tender in thee
against giving to one of them of the flesh of his sons whom he eateth
`The tender woman in thee
and against her seed which cometh out from between her feet
`If thou dost not observe to do all the words of this law which are written in this book
then hath Jehovah made wonderful thy strokes
`And He hath brought back on thee all the diseases of Egypt
also every sickness and every stroke which is not written in the book of this law; Jehovah doth cause them to go up upon thee till thou art destroyed
and ye have been left with few men
`And it hath been
and Jehovah hath scattered thee among all the peoples
`And among those nations thou dost not rest
and thy life hath been hanging in suspense before thee
in the morning thou sayest
`And Jehovah hath brought thee back to Egypt with ships
