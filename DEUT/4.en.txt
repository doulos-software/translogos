`And now
Ye do not add to the word which I am commanding you
`Your eyes are seeing that which Jehovah hath done in Baal-Peor
and ye who are cleaving to Jehovah your God
`See
and ye have kept and done `them' (for it `is' your wisdom and your understanding) before the eyes of the peoples who hear all these statutes
`For which `is' the great nation that hath God near unto it
and which `is' the great nation which hath righteous statutes and judgments according to all this law which I am setting before you to-day?"
`Only
`The day when thou hast stood before Jehovah thy God in Horeb -- in Jehovah's saying unto me
and ye draw near and stand under the mountain
`And Jehovah speaketh unto you out of the midst of the fire; a voice of words ye are hearing and a similitude ye are not seeing
and He declareth to you His covenant
`And me hath Jehovah commanded at that time to teach you statutes and judgments
and ye have been very watchful of your souls
lest ye do corruptly
a form of any beast which `is' in the earth -- a form of any winged bird which flieth in the heavens --"
a form of any creeping thing on the ground -- a form of any fish which `is' in the waters under the earth;"
`And lest thou lift up thine eyes towards the heavens
`And you hath Jehovah taken
`And Jehovah hath shewed himself wroth with me because of your words
for I am dying in this land; I am not passing over the Jordan
`Take heed to yourselves
for Jehovah thy God is a fire consuming -- a zealous God."
`When thou begettest sons and sons' sons
I have caused to testify against you this day the heavens and the earth
and Jehovah hath scattered you among the peoples
and ye have served there gods
`And -- ye have sought from thence Jehovah thy God
in distress `being' to thee
for a merciful God `is' Jehovah thy God; He doth not fail thee
`For
Hath a people heard the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire
Or hath God tried to go in to take to Himself
Thou
`From the heavens He hath caused thee to hear His voice
`And because that He hath loved thy fathers
to dispossess nations greater and stronger than thou
`And thou hast known to-day
and thou hast kept His statutes and His commands which I am commanding thee to-day
Then Moses separateth three cities beyond the Jordan
for the fleeing thither of the man-slayer
Bezer
And this `is' the law which Moses hath set before the sons of Israel;"
these `are' the testimonies
beyond the Jordan
and they possess his land
from Aroer
and all the plain beyond the Jordan eastward
