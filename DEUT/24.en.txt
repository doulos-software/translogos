`When a man doth take a wife
and she hath gone out of his house
and the latter man hath hated her
`Her former husband who sent her away is not able to turn back to take her to be to him for a wife
`When a man taketh a new wife
`None doth take in pledge millstones
`When a man is found stealing a person
`Take heed
remember that which Jehovah thy God hath done to Miriam in the way
`When thou liftest up on thy brother a debt of anything
at the outside thou dost stand
`And if he is a poor man
thou dost certainly give back to him the pledge at the going in of the sun
`Thou dost not oppress a hireling
in his day thou dost give his hire
`Fathers are not put to death for sons
`Thou dost not turn aside the judgment of a fatherless sojourner
and thou hast remembered that a servant thou hast been in Egypt
`When thou reapest thy harvest in thy field
`When thou beatest thine olive
`When thou cuttest thy vineyard
and thou hast remembered that a servant thou hast been in the land of Egypt; therefore I am commanding thee to do this thing."
