`Sons ye `are' to Jehovah your God; ye do not cut yourselves
for a holy people `art' thou to Jehovah thy God
`Thou dost not eat any abominable thing;"
`this `is' the beast which ye do eat: ox
hart
and every beast dividing the hoof
`Only
and the sow
`This ye do eat of all that `are' in the waters; all that hath fins and scales ye do eat;"
and anything which hath not fins and scales ye do not eat; unclean it `is' to you."
`Any clean bird ye do eat;"
and these `are' they of which ye do not eat: the eagle
and the glede
and every raven after its kind;"
and the owl
the `little' owl
and the pelican
and the stork
and every teeming thing which is flying
any clean fowl ye do eat."
`Ye do not eat of any carcase; to the sojourner who `is' within thy gates thou dost give it
`Thou dost certainly tithe all the increase of thy seed which the field is bringing forth year by year;"
and thou hast eaten before Jehovah thy God
`And when the way is too much for thee
then thou hast given `it' in money
and thou hast given the money for any thing which thy soul desireth
As to the Levite who `is' within thy gates
`At the end of three years thou dost bring out all the tithe of thine increase in that year
and come in hath the Levite (for he hath no part and inheritance with thee)
