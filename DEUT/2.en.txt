`And we turn
`And Jehovah speaketh unto me
Enough to you -- is the going round of this mount; turn for yourselves northward."
`And the people command thou
ye do not strive with them
`Food ye buy from them with money
for Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hands; He hath known thy walking in this great wilderness these forty years; Jehovah thy God `is' with thee; thou hast not lacked anything."
`And we pass by from our brethren
and Jehovah saith unto me
`The Emim formerly have dwelt in it
Rephaim they are reckoned
And in Seir have the Horim dwelt formerly; and the sons of Esau dispossess them
now
`And the days which we have walked from Kadesh-Barnea until that we have passed over the brook Zered
and also the hand of Jehovah hath been against them
`And it cometh to pass
that Jehovah speaketh unto me
Thou art passing over to-day the border of Moab
and thou hast come near over-against the sons of Ammon
`A land of Rephaim it is reckoned
a people great
as He hath done for the sons of Esau
`As to the Avim who are dwelling in Hazerim unto Azzah
`Rise ye
This day I begin to put thy dread and thy fear on the face of the peoples under the whole heavens
`And I send messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth
Let me pass over through thy land; in the several ways I go; I turn not aside -- right or left --"
food for money thou dost sell me
as the sons of Esau who are dwelling in Seir
`And Sihon king of Heshbon hath not been willing to let us pass over by him
`And Jehovah saith unto me
`And Sihon cometh out to meet us
and Jehovah our God giveth him before us
and we capture all his cities at that time
only
`From Aroer
`Only
