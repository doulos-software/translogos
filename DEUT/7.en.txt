`When Jehovah thy God doth bring thee in unto the land whither thou art going in to possess it
and Jehovah thy God hath given them before thee
`And thou dost not join in marriage with them; thy daughter thou dost not give to his son
for he doth turn aside thy son from after Me
`But thus thou dost to them: their altars ye break down
for a holy people `art' thou to Jehovah thy God; on thee hath Jehovah thy God fixed
`Not because of your being more numerous than any of the peoples hath Jehovah delighted in you
but because of Jehovah's loving you
`And thou hast known that Jehovah thy God He `is' God
and repaying to those hating Him
and thou hast kept the command
`And it hath been
and hath loved thee
`Blessed art thou above all the peoples
and Jehovah hath turned aside from thee every sickness
`And thou hast consumed all the peoples whom Jehovah thy God is giving to thee; thine eye hath no pity on them
`When thou sayest in thine heart
thou art not afraid of them; thou dost surely remember that which Jehovah thy God hath done to Pharaoh
the great trials which thine eyes have seen
`And also the locust doth Jehovah thy God send among them
thou art not terrified by their presence
`And Jehovah thy God hath cast out these nations from thy presence little `by' little
and Jehovah thy God hath given them before thee
and He hath given their kings into thy hand
`The graven images of their gods ye do burn with fire; thou dost not desire the silver and gold on them
and thou dost not bring in an abomination unto thy house -- or thou hast been devoted like it; -- thou dost utterly detest it
