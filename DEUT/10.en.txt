`At that time hath Jehovah said unto me
and I write on the tables the words which were on the first tables
and I make an ark of shittim wood
`And He writeth on the tables
and I turn and come down from the mount
`And the sons of Israel have journeyed from Beeroth of the sons of Jaakan to Mosera
thence they journeyed to Gudgodah
`At that time hath Jehovah separated the tribe of Levi
therefore there hath not been to Levi a portion and inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah Himself `is' his inheritance
`And I -- I have stood in the mount
`And Jehovah saith unto me
`And now
to keep the commands of Jehovah
`Lo
only in thy fathers hath Jehovah delighted -- to love them
and ye have circumcised the foreskin of your heart
for Jehovah your God -- He `is' God of the gods
He is doing the judgment of fatherless and widow
`And ye have loved the sojourner
`Jehovah thy God thou dost fear
He `is' thy praise
with seventy persons did thy fathers go down to Egypt
