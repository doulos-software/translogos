`When one is found slain on the ground which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee to possess it -- fallen in a field -- it is not known who hath smitten him
then have thine elders and thy judges gone out and measured unto the cities which `are' round about the slain one
and it hath been
and the elders of that city have brought down the heifer unto a hard valley
`And the priests
and all the elders of that city
and they have answered and said
receive atonement for Thy people Israel
and thou dost put away the innocent blood out of thy midst
`When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies
and hast seen in the captivity a woman of fair form
then thou hast brought her in unto the midst of thy household
and turned aside the raiment of her captivity from off her
`And it hath been -- if thou hast not delighted in her
`When a man hath two wives
then it hath been
But the first-born
`When a man hath a son apostatizing and rebellious -- he is not hearkening to the voice of his father
then laid hold on him have his father and his mother
and have said unto the elders of his city
and all the men of his city have stoned him with stones
`And when there is in a man a sin -- a cause of death
his corpse doth not remain on the tree
