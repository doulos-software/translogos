`When there ariseth in your midst a prophet
and the sign and the wonder hath come which he hath spoken of unto thee
thou dost not hearken unto the words of that prophet
after Jehovah your God ye walk
`And that prophet
`When thy brother -- son of thy mother
of the gods of the peoples who `are' round about you
thou dost not consent to him
`But thou dost surely kill him; thy hand is on him
and thou hast stoned him with stones
and all Israel do hear and fear
`When thou hearest
Men
and thou hast enquired
`Thou dost surely smite the inhabitants of that city by the mouth of the sword; devoting it
and all its spoil thou dost gather unto the midst of its broad place
and there doth not cleave to thy hand any of the devoted thing
when thou dost hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God
