And Moses calleth unto all Israel
Jehovah our God made with us a covenant in Horeb;"
not with our fathers hath Jehovah made this covenant
Face to face hath Jehovah spoken with you
I am standing between Jehovah and you
`I Jehovah `am' thy God
`Thou hast no other gods in My presence."
`Thou dost not make to thee a graven image
thou dost not bow thyself to them nor serve them
and doing kindness to thousands
`Thou dost not take up the Name of Jehovah thy God for a vain thing
`Observe the day of the sabbath -- to sanctify it
six days thou dost labour
and the seventh day `is' a sabbath to Jehovah thy God; thou dost not do any work
and thou hast remembered that a servant thou hast been in the land of Egypt
`Honour thy father and thy mother
`Thou dost not murder."
`Thou dost not commit adultery."
`Thou dost not steal."
`Thou dost not answer against thy neighbour -- a false testimony."
`Thou dost not desire thy neighbour's wife; nor dost thou covet thy neighbour's house
`These words hath Jehovah spoken unto all your assembly
`And it cometh to pass as ye hear the voice out of the midst of the darkness
and say
`And
For who of all flesh `is' he who hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire like us -- and doth live?"
Draw near thou
`And Jehovah heareth the voice of your words
O that their heart had been thus to them
`Go
and thou here stand thou with Me
`And ye have observed to do as Jehovah your God hath commanded you
in all the way which Jehovah your God hath commanded you ye walk
