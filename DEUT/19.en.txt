`When Jehovah thy God doth cut off the nations
three cities thou dost separate for thee in the midst of thy land which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee to possess it."
Thou dost prepare for thee the way
`And this `is' the matter of the man-slayer who fleeth thither
even he who cometh in with his neighbour into a forest to hew wood
lest the redeemer of blood pursue after the man-slayer when his heart is hot
therefore I am commanding thee
`And if Jehovah thy God doth enlarge thy border
when thou keepest all this command to do it
and innocent blood is not shed in the midst of thy land which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee -- an inheritance
`And when a man is hating his neighbour
then the elders of his city have sent and taken him from thence
thine eye hath no pity on him
`Thou dost not remove a border of thy neighbour
`One witness doth not rise against a man for any iniquity
`When a violent witness doth rise against a man
then have both the men who have the strife stood before Jehovah
and the judges have searched diligently
`Then ye have done to him as he devised to do to his brother
and those who are left do hear and fear
and thine eye doth not pity -- life for life
