`And it hath been
and hast turned back unto Jehovah thy God
then hath Jehovah thy God turned back `to' thy captivity
`If thine outcast is in the extremity of the heavens
and Jehovah thy God hath brought thee in unto the land which thy fathers have possessed
`And Jehovah thy God hath circumcised thy heart
and Jehovah thy God hath put all this oath on thine enemies
`And thou dost turn back
and Jehovah thy God hath made thee abundant in every work of thy hand
for thou dost hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God
`For this command which I am commanding thee to-day
It is not in the heavens
And it `is' not beyond the sea
For very near unto thee is the word
`See
in that I am commanding thee to-day to love Jehovah thy God
`And if thy heart doth turn
I have declared to you this day
`I have caused to testify against you to-day the heavens and the earth; life and death I have set before thee
to love Jehovah thy God
