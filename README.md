# translogos
### Bible text with important words transliterated.

The goal here is to have an open-licensed Bible translation that has common and/or important words transliterated from the original language.

[translogos](https://doulos-software.github.io/translogos/)

This project will have these outputs:
- The [Glossary]() contains a list of words that have been replaced and definitions
- Bible = the 66 books in plain text and easily linkable
 - this will ultimately be in english, greek, and hebrew (preferably unicode)
 - each chapter will be accessible via URL (yay Github!) and each verse by line number (congruent)

Based on YLT version.

This is a work in progress...content gets munged as time allows.
