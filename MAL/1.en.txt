The burden of a word of Jehovah unto Israel by the hand of Malachi:"
I have loved you
Is not Esau Jacob's brother? -- an affirmation of Jehovah
Because Edom saith
And your eyes do see
A son honoureth a father
Ye are bringing nigh on Mine altar polluted bread
And when ye bring nigh the blind for sacrifice
And now
Who `is' even among you
For
And ye are polluting it in your saying
And ye have said
And cursed `is' a deceiver
