Lo
And who is bearing the day of his coming? And who is standing in his appearing? For he `is' as fire of a refiner
And he hath sat
And sweet to Jehovah hath been the present of Judah and Jerusalem
And I have drawn near to you for judgment
For I `am' Jehovah
Even from the days of your fathers Ye have turned aside from My statutes
Doth man deceive God? but ye are deceiving Me
With a curse ye are cursed! And Me ye are deceiving -- this nation -- all of it."
Bring in all the tithe unto the treasure-house
And I have pushed for you against the consumer
And declared you happy have all the nations
Hard against Me have been your words
Ye have said
And now
Then have those fearing Jehovah spoken one to another
And they have been to Me
And ye have turned back and considered
