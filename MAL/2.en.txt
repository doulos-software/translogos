And now
If ye hearken not
Lo
And ye have known that I have sent unto you this charge
My covenant hath been with him of life and of peace
The law of truth hath been in his mouth
For the lips of a priest preserve knowledge
And ye
And I also
Have we not all one father? Hath not our God prepared us? Wherefore do we deal treacherously
Dealt treacherously hath Judah
Cut off doth Jehovah the man who doth it
And this a second time ye do
And ye have said
And He did not make one `only'
For `I' hate sending away
Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words
