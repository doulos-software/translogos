Better `is' a name than good perfume
Better to go unto a house of mourning
Better `is' sorrow than laughter
The heart of the wise `is' in a house of mourning
Better to hear a rebuke of a wise man
For as the noise of thorns under the pot
Surely oppression maketh the wise mad
Better `is' the latter end of a thing than its beginning
Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry
Say not thou
Wisdom `is' good with an inheritance
For wisdom `is' a defense
See the work of God
In a day of prosperity be in gladness
The whole I have considered in the days of my vanity. There is a righteous one perishing in his righteousness
Be not over-righteous
Do not much wrong
`It is' good that thou dost lay hold on this
The wisdom giveth strength to a wise man
Because there is not a righteous man on earth that doth good and sinneth not."
Also to all the words that they speak give not thy heart
For many times also hath thy heart known that thou thyself also hast reviled others."
All this I have tried by wisdom; I have said
Far off `is' that which hath been
I have turned round
And I am finding more bitter than death
See
(that still my soul had sought
See
