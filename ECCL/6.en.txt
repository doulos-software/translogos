There is an evil that I have seen under the sun
A man to whom God giveth wealth
If a man doth beget a hundred
For in vanity he came in
Even the sun he hath not seen nor known
And though he had lived a thousand years twice over
All the labour of man `is' for his mouth
For what advantage `is' to the wise above the fool? What to the poor who knoweth to walk before the living?"
Better `is' the sight of the eyes than the going of the soul. This also `is' vanity and vexation of spirit."
What `is' that which hath been? already is its name called
For there are many things multiplying vanity; what advantage `is' to man?"
For who knoweth what `is' good for a man in life
