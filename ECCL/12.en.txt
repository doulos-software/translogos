Remember also thy Creators in days of thy youth
While that the sun is not darkened
In the day that keepers of the house tremble
And doors have been shut in the street. When the noise of the grinding is low
Also of that which is high they are afraid
While that the silver cord is not removed
And the dust returneth to the earth as it was
Vanity of vanities
And further
The preacher sought to find out pleasing words
Words of the wise `are' as goads
And further
The end of the whole matter let us hear: -- `Fear God
For every work doth God bring into judgment
