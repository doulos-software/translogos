Who `is' as the wise? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? The wisdom of man causeth his face to shine
I pray thee
Be not troubled at his presence
Where the word of a king `is' power `is'
Whoso is keeping a command knoweth no evil thing
For to every delight there is a time and a judgment
For he knoweth not that which shall be
There is no man ruling over the spirit to restrain the spirit
All this I have seen so as to give my heart to every work that hath been done under the sun; a time that man hath ruled over man to his own evil."
And so I have seen the wicked buried
Because sentence hath not been done `on' an evil work speedily
Though a sinner is doing evil a hundred `times'
And good is not to the wicked
There is a vanity that hath been done upon the earth
And I have praised mirth because there is no good to man under the sun except to eat and to drink
When I gave my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that hath been done on the earth
then I considered all the work of God
