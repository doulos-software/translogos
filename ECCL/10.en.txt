Dead flies cause a perfumer's perfume To send forth a stink; The precious by reason of wisdom -- By reason of honour -- a little folly!"
The heart of the wise `is' at his right hand
And also
If the spirit of the ruler go up against thee
There is an evil I have seen under the sun
He hath set the fool in many high places
I have seen servants on horses
Whoso is digging a pit falleth into it
Whoso is removing stones is grieved by them
If the iron hath been blunt
If the serpent biteth without enchantment
Words of the mouth of the wise `are' gracious
The beginning of the words of his mouth `is' folly
And the fool multiplieth words: `Man knoweth not that which is
The labour of the foolish wearieth him
Wo to thee
Happy art thou
By slothfulness is the wall brought low
For mirth they are making a feast
Even in thy mind a king revile not
