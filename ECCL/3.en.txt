To everything -- a season
A time to bring forth
A time to slay
A time to weep
A time to cast away stones
A time to seek
A time to rend
A time to love
What advantage hath the doer in that which he is labouring at?"
I have seen the travail that God hath given to the sons of man to be humbled by it."
The whole He hath made beautiful in its season; also
I have known that there is no good for them except to rejoice and to do good during their life
yea
I have known that all that God doth is to the age
What is that which hath been? already it is
And again
I said in my heart
I said in my heart concerning the matter of the sons of man that God might cleanse them
For an event `is to' the sons of man
The whole are going unto one place
Who knoweth the spirit of the sons of man that is going up on high
And I have seen that there is nothing better than that man rejoice in his works
