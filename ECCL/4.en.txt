And I have turned
And I am praising the dead who have already died above the living who are yet alive."
And better than both of them `is' he who hath not yet been
And I have seen all the labour
The fool is clasping his hands
`Better `is' a handful `with' quietness
And I have turned
There is one
The two `are' better than the one
For if they fall
Also
And if the one strengthen himself
Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king
For from a house of prisoners he hath come out to reign
I have seen all the living
there is no end to all the people
