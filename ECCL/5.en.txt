Keep thy feet when thou goest unto a house of God
Cause not thy mouth to hasten
For the dream hath come by abundance of business
When thou vowest a vow to God
Better that thou do not vow
Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin
For
If oppression of the poor
And the abundance of a land is for all. A king for a field is served."
Whoso is loving silver is not satisfied `with' silver
In the multiplying of good have its consumers been multiplied
Sweet `is' the sleep of the labourer whether he eat little or much; and the sufficiency of the wealthy is not suffering him to sleep."
There is a painful evil I have seen under the sun: wealth kept for its possessor
And that wealth hath been lost in an evil business
As he came out from the belly of his mother
And this also `is' a painful evil
Also all his days in darkness he consumeth
Lo
Every man also to whom God hath given wealth and riches
For he doth not much remember the days of his life
