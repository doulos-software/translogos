I said in my heart
Of laughter I said
I have sought in my heart to draw out with wine my appetite
I made great my works
I made for me gardens and paradises
I made for me pools of water
I got men-servants
I gathered for me also silver and gold
And I became great
And all that mine eyes asked I kept not back from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy
and I have looked on all my works that my hands have done
And I turned to see wisdom
And I saw that there is an advantage to wisdom above folly
The wise! -- his eyes `are' in his head
and I said in my heart
That there is no remembrance to the wise -- with the fool -- to the age
And I have hated life
And I have hated all my labour that I labour at under the sun
And who knoweth whether he is wise or foolish? yet he doth rule over all my labour that I have laboured at
And I turned round to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labour that I laboured at under the sun."
For there is a man whose labour `is' in wisdom
For what hath been to a man by all his labour
For all his days are sorrows
There is nothing good in a man who eateth
For who eateth and who hasteth out more than I?"
For to a man who `is' good before Him
