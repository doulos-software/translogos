But all this I have laid unto my heart
The whole `is' as to the whole; one event is to the righteous and to the wicked
This `is' an evil among all that hath been done under the sun
But `to' him who is joined unto all the living there is confidence
For the living know that they die
Their love also
Go
At all times let thy garments be white
See life with the wife whom thou hast loved
All that thy hand findeth to do
I have turned so as to see under the sun
For even man knoweth not his time; as fish that are taken hold of by an evil net
This also I have seen: wisdom under the sun
A little city
and there hath been found in it a poor wise man
And I said
The words of the wise in quiet are heard
Better `is' wisdom than weapons of conflict
