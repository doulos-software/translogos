Send forth thy bread on the face of the waters
Give a portion to seven
If the thick clouds are full of rain
Whoso is observing the wind soweth not
As thou knowest not what `is' the way of the spirit
In the morning sow thy seed
Sweet also `is' the light
But
Rejoice
And turn aside anger from thy heart
