And He saith unto me
And I open my mouth
And He saith unto me
And He saith unto me
For
not unto many peoples
but the house of Israel are not willing to hearken unto thee
`Lo
As an adamant harder than a rock I have made thy forehead; thou dost not fear them
And He saith unto me
and go
And lift me up doth a spirit
even a noise of the wings of the living creatures touching one another
And a spirit hath lifted me up
And I come in unto the Removed
And it cometh to pass
that there is a word of Jehovah unto me
In My saying to the wicked: Thou dost surely die; and thou hast not warned him
And thou
`And in the turning back of the righteous from his righteousness
And thou
And there is on me there a hand of Jehovah
And I rise and go forth unto the valley
And come into me doth a spirit
`And thou
and thy tongue I cause to cleave unto thy palate
And in My speaking with thee
