And it cometh to pass
`Son of man
Lo
Waters have made it great
Therefore higher hath been his stature than all trees of the field
In his boughs made a nest hath every fowl of the heavens
And he is fair in his greatness
Cedars have not hid him in the garden of God
Fair I have made him in the multitude of his thin shoots
Therefore
I give him into the hand of a god of nations
And cut him off do strangers
On his ruin dwell do all fowls of the heavens
In order that none of the trees of the waters May become haughty because of their stature
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the day of his going down to sheol I have caused mourning
From the sound of his fall I have caused nations to shake
Also they with him have gone down to sheol
Unto whom hast thou been thus like
