"26001001","26","1","1","And it cometh to pass, in the thirtieth year, in the fourth `month', in the fifth of the month, and I `am' in the midst of the Removed by the river Chebar, the heavens have been opened, and I see visions of God."
"26001002","26","1","2","In the fifth of the month -- it is the fifth year of the removal of the king Jehoiachin --"
"26001003","26","1","3","hath the word of Jehovah certainly been unto Ezekiel son of Buzi the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chebar, and there is on him there a hand of Jehovah."
"26001004","26","1","4","And I look, and lo, a tempestuous wind is coming from the north, a great cloud, and fire catching itself, and brightness to it round about, and out of its midst as the colour of copper, out of the midst of the fire."
"26001005","26","1","5","And out of its midst `is' a likeness of four living creatures, and this `is' their appearance; a likeness of man `is' to them,"
"26001006","26","1","6","and four faces `are' to each, and four wings `are' to each of them,"
"26001007","26","1","7","and their feet `are' straight feet, and the sole of their feet `is' as a sole of a calf's foot, and they are sparkling as the colour of bright brass;"
"26001008","26","1","8","and hands of man under their wings -- on their four sides, and their faces and their wings -- `are' to them four;"
"26001009","26","1","9","joining one unto another `are' their wings, they turn not round in their going, each straight forward they go."
"26001010","26","1","10","As to the likeness of their faces, the face of a man, and the face of a lion, toward the right `are' to them four, and the face of an ox on the left `are' to them four, and the face of an eagle `are' to them four."
"26001011","26","1","11","And their faces and their wings are separate from above, to each `are' two joining together, and two are covering their bodies."
"26001012","26","1","12","And each straight forward they go, whither the spirit is to go, they go, they turn not round in their going."
"26001013","26","1","13","As to the likeness of the living creatures, their appearances `are' as coals of fire -- burning as the appearance of lamps; it is going up and down between the living creatures, and brightness `is' to the fire, and out of the fire is going forth lightning."
"26001014","26","1","14","And the living creatures are running, and turning back, as the appearance of the flash."
"26001015","26","1","15","And I see the living creatures, and lo, one wheel `is' in the earth, near the living creatures, at its four faces."
"26001016","26","1","16","The appearance of the wheels and their works `is' as the colour of beryl, and one likeness `is' to them four, and their appearances and their works `are' as it were the wheel in the midst of the wheel."
"26001017","26","1","17","On their four sides, in their going they go, they turn not round in their going."
"26001018","26","1","18","As to their rings, they are both high and fearful, and their rings `are' full of eyes round about them four."
"26001019","26","1","19","And in the going of the living creatures, the wheels go beside them, and in the living creatures being lifted up from off the earth, lifted up are the wheels."
"26001020","26","1","20","Whither the spirit is to go, they go, thither the spirit `is' to go, and the wheels are lifted up over-against them, for a living spirit `is' in the wheels."
"26001021","26","1","21","In their going, they go; and in their standing, they stand; and in their being lifted up from off the earth, lifted up are the wheels over-against them; for a living spirit `is' in the wheels."
"26001022","26","1","22","And a likeness `is' over the heads of the living creatures of an expanse, as the colour of the fearful ice, stretched out over their heads from above."
"26001023","26","1","23","And under the expanse their wings `are' straight, one toward the other, to each are two covering on this side, and to each are two covering on that side -- their bodies."
"26001024","26","1","24","And I hear the noise of their wings, as the noise of many waters, as the noise of the Mighty One, in their going -- the noise of tumult, as the noise of a camp, in their standing they let fall their wings."
"26001025","26","1","25","And there is a voice from above the expanse, that `is' above their head: in their standing they let fall their wings."
"26001026","26","1","26","And above the expanse that `is' over their head, as an appearance of a sapphire stone, `is' the likeness of a throne, and on the likeness of the throne a likeness, as the appearance of man upon it from above."
"26001027","26","1","27","And I see as the colour of copper, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward, and from the appearance of his loins and downward, I have seen as the appearance of fire, and brightness `is' to it round about."
"26001028","26","1","28","As the appearance of the bow that is in a cloud in a day of rain, so `is' the appearance of the brightness round about."
"26002001","26","2","1","It `is' the appearance of the likeness of the honour of Jehovah, and I see, and fall on my face, and I hear a voice speaking, and He saith unto me, `Son of man, stand on thy feet, and I speak with thee.'"
"26002002","26","2","2","And there doth come into me a spirit, when He hath spoken unto me, and it causeth me to stand on my feet, and I hear Him who is speaking unto me."
"26002003","26","2","3","And He saith unto Me, `Son of man, I am sending thee unto the sons of Israel, unto nations who are rebels, who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me, unto this self-same day."
"26002004","26","2","4","And the sons `are' brazen-faced and hard-hearted to whom I am sending thee, and thou hast said unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah:"
"26002005","26","2","5","and they -- whether they hear, or whether they forbear, for a rebellious house they `are' -- have known that a prophet hath been in their midst."
"26002006","26","2","6","`And thou, son of man, thou art not afraid of them, yea, of their words thou art not afraid, for briers and thorns are with thee, and near scorpions thou art dwelling, of their words thou art not afraid, and of their faces thou art not affrighted, for they `are' a rebellious house,"
"26002007","26","2","7","And thou hast spoken My words unto them, whether they hear or whether they forbear, for they `are' rebellious."
"26002008","26","2","8","`And thou, son of man, hear that which I am speaking unto thee: Thou art not rebellious like the rebellious house, open thy mouth, and eat that which I am giving unto thee.'"
"26002009","26","2","9","And I look, and lo, a hand `is' sent forth unto me, and lo, in it a roll of a book,"
"26002010","26","2","10","and He spreadeth it before me, and it is written in front and behind, and written on it `are' lamentations, and mourning, and wo!"
"26003001","26","3","1","And He saith unto me, `Son of man, that which thou findest eat, eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.'"
"26003002","26","3","2","And I open my mouth, and He causeth me to eat this roll."
"26003003","26","3","3","And He saith unto me, `Son of man, thy belly thou dost feed, and thy bowels thou dost fill with this roll that I am giving unto thee;' and I eat it, and it is in my mouth as honey for sweetness."
"26003004","26","3","4","And He saith unto me, `Son of man, go, enter in unto the house of Israel, and thou hast spoken with My words unto them."
"26003005","26","3","5","For, not unto a people deep of lip and heavy of tongue `art' thou sent -- unto the house of Israel;"
"26003006","26","3","6","not unto many peoples, deep of lip and heavy of tongue, whose words thou dost not understand. If I had not sent thee unto them -- they, they do hearken unto thee,"
"26003007","26","3","7","but the house of Israel are not willing to hearken unto thee, for they are not willing to hearken unto Me, for all the house of Israel are brazen-faced and strong-hearted."
"26003008","26","3","8","`Lo, I have made thy face strong against their face, and thy forehead strong against their forehead."
"26003009","26","3","9","As an adamant harder than a rock I have made thy forehead; thou dost not fear them, nor art thou affrighted before them, for a rebellious house `are' they.'"
"26003010","26","3","10","And He saith unto me, `Son of man, all My words, that I speak unto thee, receive with thy heart, and with thine ears hear;"
"26003011","26","3","11","and go, enter in unto the Removed, unto the sons of thy people, and thou hast spoken unto them, and hast said unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: whether they hear, or whether they forbear.'"
"26003012","26","3","12","And lift me up doth a spirit, and I hear behind me a noise, a great rushing -- `Blessed `is' the honour of Jehovah from His place!' --"
"26003013","26","3","13","even a noise of the wings of the living creatures touching one another, and a noise of the wheels over-against them, even a noise of a great rushing."
"26003014","26","3","14","And a spirit hath lifted me up, and doth take me away, and I go bitterly, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of Jehovah on me `is' strong."
"26003015","26","3","15","And I come in unto the Removed, at Tel-Ahib, who are dwelling at the river Chebar, and where they are dwelling I also dwell seven days, causing astonishment in their midst."
"26003016","26","3","16","And it cometh to pass, at the end of seven days,"
"26003017","26","3","17","that there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying, `Son of man, a watchman I have given thee to the house of Israel, and thou hast heard from My mouth a word, and hast warned them from Me."
"26003018","26","3","18","In My saying to the wicked: Thou dost surely die; and thou hast not warned him, nor hast spoken to warn the wicked from his wicked way, so that he doth live; he -- the wicked -- in his iniquity dieth, and his blood from thy hand I require."
"26003019","26","3","19","And thou, because thou hast warned the wicked, and he hath not turned back from his wickedness, and from his wicked way, he in his iniquity dieth, and thou thy soul hast delivered."
"26003020","26","3","20","`And in the turning back of the righteous from his righteousness, and he hath done perversity, and I have put a stumbling-block before him, he dieth; because thou hast not warned him, in his sin he dieth, and not remembered is his righteousness that he hath done, and his blood from thy hand I require."
"26003021","26","3","21","And thou, because thou hast warned him -- the righteous -- that the righteous sin not, and he hath not sinned, he surely liveth, because he hath been warned; and thou thy soul hast delivered.'"
"26003022","26","3","22","And there is on me there a hand of Jehovah, and He saith to me, `Rise, go forth to the valley, and there I do speak with thee.'"
"26003023","26","3","23","And I rise and go forth unto the valley, and lo, there the honour of Jehovah is standing as the honour that I had seen by the river Chebar, and I fall on my face."
"26003024","26","3","24","And come into me doth a spirit, and causeth me to stand on my feet, and He speaketh with me, and saith unto me, `Go in, be shut up in the midst of thy house."
"26003025","26","3","25","`And thou, son of man, lo, they have put on thee thick bands, and have bound thee with them, and thou goest not forth in their midst;"
"26003026","26","3","26","and thy tongue I cause to cleave unto thy palate, and thou hast been dumb, and art not to them for a reprover, for a rebellious house `are' they."
"26003027","26","3","27","And in My speaking with thee, I do open thy mouth, and thou hast said unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah; the hearer doth hear, and the forbearer doth forbear; for a rebellious house `are' they."
"26004001","26","4","1","`And thou, son of man, take to thee a brick, and thou hast put it before thee, and hast graven on it a city -- Jerusalem,"
"26004002","26","4","2","and hast placed against it a siege, and builded against it a fortification, and poured out against it a mount, and placed against it camps, yea, set thou against it battering-rams round about."
"26004003","26","4","3","And thou, take to thee an iron pan, and thou hast made it a wall of iron between thee and the city; and thou hast prepared thy face against it, and it hath been in a siege, yea, thou hast laid siege against it. A sign it `is' to the house of Israel."
"26004004","26","4","4","`And thou, lie on thy left side, and thou hast placed the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; the number of the days that thou liest on it, thou bearest their iniquity."
"26004005","26","4","5","And I -- I have laid on thee the years of their iniquity, the number of days, three hundred and ninety days; and thou hast borne the iniquity of the house of Israel."
"26004006","26","4","6","And thou hast completed these, and hast lain on thy right side, a second time, and hast borne the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days -- a day for a year -- a day for a year I have appointed to thee."
"26004007","26","4","7","`And unto the siege of Jerusalem thou dost prepare thy face, and thine arm `is' uncovered, and thou hast prophesied concerning it."
"26004008","26","4","8","And lo, I have put on thee thick bands, and thou dost not turn from side to side till thy completing the days of thy siege."
"26004009","26","4","9","`And thou, take to thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and spelt, and thou hast put them in one vessel, and made them to thee for bread; the number of the days that thou art lying on thy side -- three hundred and ninety days -- thou dost eat it."
"26004010","26","4","10","And thy food that thou dost eat `is' by weight, twenty shekels daily; from time to time thou dost eat it."
"26004011","26","4","11","`And water by measure thou dost drink, a sixth part of the hin; from time to time thou dost drink `it'."
"26004012","26","4","12","A barley-cake thou dost eat it, and it with dung -- the filth of man -- thou dost bake before their eyes."
"26004013","26","4","13","And Jehovah saith, `Thus do the sons of Israel eat their defiled bread among the nations whither I drive them.'"
"26004014","26","4","14","And I say, `Ah, Lord Jehovah, lo, my soul is not defiled, and carcase, and torn thing, I have not eaten from my youth, even till now; nor come into my mouth hath abominable flesh.'"
"26004015","26","4","15","And He saith unto me, `See, I have given to thee bullock's dung instead of man's dung, and thou hast made thy bread by it.'"
"26004016","26","4","16","And He saith unto me, `Son of man, lo, I am breaking the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they have eaten bread by weight and with fear; and water by measure and with astonishment, they do drink;"
"26004017","26","4","17","so that they lack bread and water, and have been astonished one with another, and been consumed in their iniquity."
"26005001","26","5","1","`And thou, son of man, take to thee a sharp weapon, the barber's razor thou dost take to thee, and thou hast caused `it' to pass over thy head, and over thy beard, and thou hast taken to thee weighing scales, and apportioned them."
"26005002","26","5","2","A third part with fire thou dost burn in the midst of the city, at the fulness of the days of the siege; and thou hast taken the third part, thou dost smite with a weapon round about it; and the third part thou dost scatter to the wind, and a weapon I draw out after them."
"26005003","26","5","3","And thou hast taken thence a few in number -- and hast bound them in thy skirts;"
"26005004","26","5","4","and of them thou dost take again, and hast cast them unto the midst of the fire, and hast burned them in the fire -- out of it cometh forth a fire unto all the house of Israel."
"26005005","26","5","5","Thus said the Lord Jehovah: this `is' Jerusalem, In the midst of the nations I have set her, And round about her `are' the lands."
"26005006","26","5","6","And she changeth My judgments into wickedness more than the nations, And My statutes more than the lands that `are' round about her, For against My judgments they have kicked, And My statutes -- they have not walked in them."
"26005007","26","5","7","Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of your multiplying above the nations that `are' around you, In My statutes ye have not walked, And My judgments ye have not done, According to the judgments of the nations That `are' round about you ye have not done."
"26005008","26","5","8","Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I `am' against thee, even I, And I have done in thy midst judgments, Before the eyes of the nations."
"26005009","26","5","9","And I have done in thee that which I have not done, And that which I do not its like again, Because of all thine abominations."
"26005010","26","5","10","Therefore fathers do eat sons in thy midst, And sons eat their fathers, And I have done in thee judgments, And have scattered all thy remnant to every wind."
"26005011","26","5","11","Therefore, I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah: Because My sanctuary thou hast defiled, With all thy detestable things, And with all thine abominations, Mine eye pitieth not, and I also spare not. Do not even I also diminish?"
"26005012","26","5","12","Thy third part -- by pestilence they die, And by famine are consumed in thy midst, And the third part, by sword they fall round about thee, And the third part, to every wind I scatter, And a sword I draw out after them."
"26005013","26","5","13","And completed hath been Mine anger, And I have caused My fury to rest on them, And I have been comforted, And they have known that I, Jehovah, have spoken in My zeal, In My completing My fury on them."
"26005014","26","5","14","And I give thee for a waste, And for a reproach among nations that `are' round about thee, Before the eyes of every passer by."
"26005015","26","5","15","And it hath been a reproach and a reviling, An instruction and an astonishment, To nations that `are' round about thee, In My doing in thee judgments, In anger and fury, and in furious reproofs, I, Jehovah, have spoken."
"26005016","26","5","16","In My sending the evil arrows of famine among them, That have been for destruction, That I send to destroy you, And famine I am adding upon you, And I have broken to you the staff of bread."
"26005017","26","5","17","And I have sent on you famine and evil beasts, And they have bereaved thee, And pestilence and blood pass over on thee, And a sword I do bring in against thee, I, Jehovah, have spoken!'"
"26006001","26","6","1","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:"
"26006002","26","6","2","`Son of man, set thy face unto mountains of Israel, and prophesy concerning them:"
"26006003","26","6","3","And thou hast said: Mountains of Israel, Hear ye a word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus said the Lord Jehovah To the mountains, and to the hills, To the streams, and to the valleys, Lo, I, I am bringing in against you a sword, And I have destroyed your high places."
"26006004","26","6","4","And desolated have been your altars, And broken your images, And I have caused your wounded to fall before your idols,"
"26006005","26","6","5","And put the carcases of the sons of Israel before their idols, And scattered your bones round about your altars."
"26006006","26","6","6","In all your dwellings the cities are laid waste, And the high places are desolate, So that waste and desolate are your altars, And broken and ceased have your idols, And cut down have been your images, And blotted out have been your works."
"26006007","26","6","7","And fallen hath the wounded in your midst, And ye have known that I `am' Jehovah."
"26006008","26","6","8","And I have caused `some' to remain, In their being to you the escaped of the sword among nations, In your being scattered through lands."
"26006009","26","6","9","And remembered Me have your escaped among nations, Whither they have been taken captive, Because I have been broken with their heart that is going a-whoring, That hath turned aside from off Me, And with their eyes they are going a-whoring after their idols, And they have been loathsome in their own faces, For the evils that they have done -- all their abominations."
"26006010","26","6","10","And they have known that I `am' Jehovah, Not for nought have I spoken to do to them this evil."
"26006011","26","6","11","Thus said the Lord Jehovah: `Smite with thy palm, and stamp with thy foot, And say: Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, Who by sword, by famine, and by pestilence do fall."
"26006012","26","6","12","The far-off by pestilence dieth, And the near by sword falleth, And the left and the besieged by famine dieth, And I have completed my fury upon them."
"26006013","26","6","13","And ye have known that I `am' Jehovah, In their wounded being in the midst of their idols, Round about their altars, On every high hill, on all tops of mountains, And under every green tree, and under every thick oak, The place where they gave sweet fragrance to all their idols."
"26006014","26","6","14","And I have stretched out my hand against them, And have made the land a desolation, Even a desolation from the wilderness to Diblath, In all their dwellings, And they have known that I `am' Jehovah!'"
"26007001","26","7","1","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying, `And thou, son of man, Thus said the Lord Jehovah to the ground of Israel:"
"26007002","26","7","2","An end, come hath the end on the four corners of the land."
"26007003","26","7","3","Now `is' the end unto thee, And I have sent Mine anger upon thee, And judged thee according to thy ways, And set against thee all thine abominations."
"26007004","26","7","4","And no pity on thee hath Mine eye, nor do I spare, For thy ways against thee I do set, And thine abominations are in thy midst, And ye have known that I `am' Jehovah."
"26007005","26","7","5","Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Evil, a single evil, lo, it hath come."

"26007008","26","7","8","Now, shortly I pour out My fury on thee, And have completed Mine anger against thee, And judged thee according to thy ways, And set against thee all thine abominations."
"26007009","26","7","9","And not pity doth Mine eye, nor do I spare, According to thy ways unto thee I give, And thine abominations are in thy midst, And ye have known that I `am' Jehovah the smiter."
"26007010","26","7","10","Lo, the day, lo, it hath come, Gone forth hath the morning, Blossomed hath the rod, flourished the pride."
"26007011","26","7","11","The violence hath risen to a rod of wickedness, There is none of them, nor of their multitude, Nor of their noise, nor is there wailing for them."
"26007012","26","7","12","Come hath the time, arrived hath the day, The buyer doth not rejoice, And the seller doth not become a mourner, For wrath `is' unto all its multitude."
"26007013","26","7","13","For the seller to the sold thing turneth not, And yet among the living `is' their life, For the vision `is' unto all its multitude, It doth not turn back, And none by his iniquity doth strengthen his life."
"26007014","26","7","14","They have blown with a trumpet to prepare the whole, And none is going to battle, For My wrath `is' unto all its multitude."
"26007015","26","7","15","The sword `is' without, And the pestilence and the famine within, He who is in a field by sword dieth, And he who is in a city, Famine and pestilence devour him."
"26007016","26","7","16","And escaped away have their fugitives, And they have been on the mountains As doves of the valleys, All of them make a noising -- each for his iniquity."
"26007017","26","7","17","All the hands are feeble, and all knees go -- waters."
"26007018","26","7","18","And they have girded on sackcloth, And covered them hath trembling, And unto all faces `is' shame, And on all their heads -- baldness."
"26007019","26","7","19","Their silver into out-places they cast, And their gold impurity becometh. Their silver and their gold is not able to deliver them, In a day of the wrath of Jehovah, Their soul they do not satisfy, And their bowels they do not fill, For the stumbling-block of their iniquity it hath been."
"26007020","26","7","20","As to the beauty of his ornament, For excellency He set it, And the images of their abominations, Their detestable things -- they made in it, Therefore I have given it to them for impurity,"
"26007021","26","7","21","And I have given it into the hand of the strangers for a prey, And to the wicked of the land for a spoil, And they have polluted it."

"26007026","26","7","26","Mischief on mischief cometh, and report is on report, And they have sought a vision from a prophet, And law doth perish from the priest, And counsel from the elders,"
"26007027","26","7","27","The king doth become a mourner, And a prince putteth on desolation, And the hands of the people of the land are troubled, From their own way I deal with them, And with their own judgments I judge them, And they have known that I `am' Jehovah!'"
"26008001","26","8","1","And it cometh to pass, in the sixth year, in the sixth `month', in the fifth of the month, I am sitting in my house, and elders of Judah are sitting before me, and fall on me there doth a hand of the Lord Jehovah,"
"26008002","26","8","2","and I look, and lo, a likeness as the appearance of fire, from the appearance of His loins and downward -- fire, and from His loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of copper."
"26008003","26","8","3","And He putteth forth a form of a hand, and taketh me by a lock of my head, and lift me up doth a spirit between the earth and the heavens, and it bringeth me in to Jerusalem in visions of God, unto the opening of the inner gate that is facing the north, where `is' the seat of the figure of jealousy that is making jealous,"
"26008004","26","8","4","and lo, there the honour of the God of Israel, as the appearance that I saw in the valley."
"26008005","26","8","5","And He saith unto me, `Son of man, lift up, I pray thee, thine eyes the way of the north.' And I lift up mine eyes the way of the north, and lo, on the north of the gate of the altar this figure of jealousy, at the entrance."
"26008006","26","8","6","And He saith unto me, `Son of man, art thou seeing what they are doing? the great abominations that the house of Israel are doing here, to keep far off from My sanctuary; and again thou dost turn, thou dost see great abominations.'"
"26008007","26","8","7","And He bringeth me in unto an opening of the court, and I look, and lo, a hole in the wall;"
"26008008","26","8","8","and He saith unto me, `Son of man, dig, I pray thee, through the wall;' and I dig through the wall, and lo, an opening."
"26008009","26","8","9","And He saith to me, `Go in, and see the evil abominations that they are doing here.'"
"26008010","26","8","10","And I go in, and look, and lo, every form of creeping thing, and detestable beast -- and all the Idols of the house of Israel -- graved on the wall, all round about,"
"26008011","26","8","11","and seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel -- and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan standing in their midst -- are standing before them, and each his censer in his hand, and the abundance of the cloud of perfume is going up."
"26008012","26","8","12","And He saith unto me, `Hast thou seen, son of man, that which elders of the house of Israel are doing in darkness, each in the inner chambers of his imagery, for they are saying, Jehovah is not seeing us, Jehovah hath forsaken the land?'"
"26008013","26","8","13","And He saith unto me, `Again thou dost turn, thou dost see great abominations that they are doing.'"
"26008014","26","8","14","And He bringeth me in unto the opening of the gate of the house of Jehovah that `is' at the north, and lo, there the women are sitting weeping for Tammuz."
"26008015","26","8","15","And He saith unto me, `Hast thou seen, son of man? again thou dost turn, thou dost see greater abominations than these.'"
"26008016","26","8","16","And He bringeth me in unto the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and lo, at the opening of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, about twenty-five men, their backs toward the temple of Jehovah, and their faces eastward, and they are bowing themselves eastward to the sun."
"26008017","26","8","17","And He saith unto me, `Hast thou seen, son of man? hath it been a light thing to the house of Judah to do the abomination that they have done here, that they have filled the land with violence, and turn back to provoke Me to anger? and lo, they are putting forth the branch unto their nose!"
"26008018","26","8","18","And I also deal in fury, Mine eye doth not pity, nor do I spare, and they have cried in Mine ears -- a loud voice -- and I do not hear them.'"
"26009001","26","9","1","And He crieth in mine ears -- a loud voice -- saying, `Drawn near have inspectors of the city, and each his destroying weapon in his hand.'"
"26009002","26","9","2","And lo, six men are coming from the way of the upper gate, that is facing the north, and each his slaughter-weapon in his hand, and one man in their midst is clothed with linen, and a scribe's inkhorn at his loins, and they come in, and stand near the brazen altar."
"26009003","26","9","3","And the honour of the God of Israel hath gone up from off the cherub, on which it hath been, unto the threshold of the house."
"26009004","26","9","4","And He calleth unto the man who is clothed with linen, who hath the scribe's inkhorn at his loins, and Jehovah saith unto him, `Pass on into the midst of the city, into the midst of Jerusalem, and thou hast made a mark on the foreheads of the men who are sighing and who are groaning for all the abominations that are done in its midst.'"
"26009005","26","9","5","And to the others he said in mine ears, `Pass on into the city after him, and smite; your eye doth not pity, nor do ye spare;"
"26009006","26","9","6","aged, young man, and virgin, and infant, and women, ye do slay -- to destruction; and against any man on whom `is' the mark ye do not go nigh, and from My sanctuary ye begin.'"
"26009007","26","9","7","And they begin among the aged men who `are' before the house, and He saith unto them, `Defile the house, and fill the courts with the wounded, go forth.' And they have gone forth and have smitten in the city."
"26009008","26","9","8","And it cometh to pass, as they are smiting, and I -- I am left -- that I fall on my face, and cry, and say, `Ah, Lord Jehovah, art Thou destroying all the remnant of Israel, in Thy pouring out Thy wrath on Jerusalem?'"
"26009009","26","9","9","And He saith unto me, `The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah `is' very very great, and the land is full of blood, and the city hath been full of perverseness, for they have said: Jehovah hath forsaken the land, and Jehovah is not seeing."
"26009010","26","9","10","And I also, Mine eye doth not pity, nor do I spare; their way on their own head I have put.'"
"26009011","26","9","11","And lo, the man clothed with linen, at whose loins `is' the inkhorn, is bringing back word, saying, `I have done as Thou hast commanded me.'"
"26010001","26","10","1","And I look, and lo, on the expanse that `is' above the head of the cherubs, as a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne, He hath been seen over them."
"26010002","26","10","2","And He speaketh unto the man clothed with linen, and saith, `Go in unto the midst of the wheel, unto the place of the cherub, and fill thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubs, and scatter over the city.' And he goeth in before mine eyes."
"26010003","26","10","3","And the cherubs are standing on the right side of the house, at the going in of the man, and the cloud hath filled the inner court,"
"26010004","26","10","4","and become high doth the honour of Jehovah above the cherub, over the threshold of the house, and the house is filled with the cloud, and the court hath been filled with the brightness of the honour of Jehovah."
"26010005","26","10","5","And a noise of the wings of the cherubs hath been heard unto the outer court, as the voice of God -- the Mighty One -- in His speaking."
"26010006","26","10","6","And it cometh to pass, in His commanding the man clothed with linen, saying, `Take fire from between the wheel, from between the cherubs,' and he goeth in and standeth near the wheel,"
"26010007","26","10","7","that the `one' cherub putteth forth his hand from between the cherubs unto the fire that `is' between the cherubs, and lifteth up, and giveth into the hands of him who is clothed with linen, and he receiveth, and cometh forth."
"26010008","26","10","8","And there appeareth in the cherubs the form of a hand of man under their wings,"
"26010009","26","10","9","and I look, and lo, four wheels near the cherubs, one wheel near the one cherub, and another wheel near the other cherub, and the appearance of the wheels `is' as the colour of a beryl stone."
"26010010","26","10","10","As to their appearances, one likeness `is' to them four, as it were the wheel in the midst of the wheel."
"26010011","26","10","11","In their going, on their four sides they go; they turn not round in their going, for to the place whither the head turneth, after it they go, they turn not round in their going."
"26010012","26","10","12","And all their flesh, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, are full of eyes round about; to them four `are' their wheels."
"26010013","26","10","13","To the wheels -- to them is one calling in mine ears, `O wheel!'"
"26010014","26","10","14","And four faces `are' to each; the face of the one `is' the face of the cherub, and the face of the second the face of man, and of the third the face of a lion, and of the fourth the face of an eagle."
"26010015","26","10","15","And the cherubs are lifted up, it `is' the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar."
"26010016","26","10","16","And in the going of the cherubs, the wheels go beside them; and in the cherubs lifting up their wings to be high above the earth, the wheels turn not round, even they, from being beside them."
"26010017","26","10","17","In their standing they stand, and in their exaltation they are exalted with them: for the living spirit `is' in them."
"26010018","26","10","18","And go forth doth the honour of Jehovah from off the threshold of the house, and standeth over the cherubs,"
"26010019","26","10","19","and the cherubs lift up their wings, and are lifted up from the earth before mine eyes; in their going forth, the wheels also `are' over-against them, and he standeth at the opening of the east gate of the house of Jehovah, and the honour of the God of Israel `is' over them from above."
"26010020","26","10","20","It `is' the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar, and I know that they are cherubs."
"26010021","26","10","21","Four faces `are' to each, and four wings to each, and the likeness of the hands of man `is' under their wings."
"26010022","26","10","22","As to the likeness of their faces, they `are' the faces that I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; each straight forward they go."
"26011001","26","11","1","And lift me up doth a spirit, and it bringeth me in unto the east gate of the house of Jehovah, that is facing the east, and lo, at the opening of the gate twenty and five men, and I see in their midst Jaazaniah son of Azzur, and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, heads of the people."
"26011002","26","11","2","And He saith unto me, `Son of man, these `are' the men who are devising iniquity, and who are giving evil counsel in this city;"
"26011003","26","11","3","who are saying, It `is' not near -- to build houses, it `is' the pot, and we the flesh."
"26011004","26","11","4","Therefore prophesy concerning them, prophesy, son of man.'"
"26011005","26","11","5","And fall upon me doth the Spirit of Jehovah, and He saith unto me, `Say: Thus said Jehovah: Rightly ye have said, O house of Israel, And the steps of your spirit I have known."
"26011006","26","11","6","Ye multiplied your wounded in this city, And filled its out-places with the wounded."
"26011007","26","11","7","Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Your wounded whom ye placed in its midst, They `are' the flesh, and it `is' the pot, And you he hath brought out from its midst."
"26011008","26","11","8","A sword ye have feared, And a sword I bring in against you, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah."
"26011009","26","11","9","And I have brought you out of its midst, And given you into the hand of strangers, And I have done among you judgments."
"26011010","26","11","10","By the sword ye do fall, On the border of Israel I do judge you, And ye have known that I `am' Jehovah."
"26011011","26","11","11","It is not to you for a pot, Nor are ye in its midst for flesh, At the border of Israel I do judge you."
"26011012","26","11","12","And ye have known that I `am' Jehovah, For in My statutes ye have not walked, And My Judgments ye have not done, And according to the judgments of the nations Who are round about you -- ye have done!'"
"26011013","26","11","13","And it cometh to pass, at my prophesying, that Pelatiah son of Benaiah is dying, and I fall on my face, and cry -- a loud voice -- and say, `Ah, Lord Jehovah, an end Thou art making of the remnant of Israel.'"
"26011014","26","11","14","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,"
"26011015","26","11","15","`Son of man, thy brethren, thy brethren, men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel -- all of it, `are' they to whom inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Keep far off from Jehovah;"
"26011016","26","11","16","it `is' ours, the land hath been given for an inheritance; therefore say: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because I put them afar off among nations, And because I scattered them through lands, I also am to them for a little sanctuary, In lands whither they have gone in."
"26011017","26","11","17","Therefore say: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And I have assembled you from the peoples, And I have gathered you from the lands, Into which ye have been scattered, And I have given to you the ground of Israel."
"26011018","26","11","18","And they have gone in thither. And turned aside all its detestable things, And all its abominations -- out of it."
"26011019","26","11","19","And I have given to them one heart, And a new spirit I do give in your midst, And I have turned the heart of stone out of their flesh, And I have given to them a heart of flesh."
"26011020","26","11","20","So that in My statutes they walk, And My judgments they keep, and have done them, And they have been to me for a people, And I am to them for God."
"26011021","26","11","21","As to those whose heart is going unto the heart Of their detestable and their abominable things, Their way on their head I have put, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.'"
"26011022","26","11","22","And the cherubs lift up their wings, and the wheels `are' over-against them, and the honour of the God of Israel `is' over them above."
"26011023","26","11","23","And the honour of Jehovah goeth up from off the midst of the city, and standeth on the mountain, that `is' on the east of the city."
"26011024","26","11","24","And a spirit hath lifted me up, and bringeth me in to Chaldea, unto the Removed, in a vision, by the Spirit of God, and go up from off me doth the vision that I have seen;"
"26011025","26","11","25","and I speak unto the Removed all the matters of Jehovah that He hath shewed me."
"26012001","26","12","1","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,"
"26012002","26","12","2","`Son of man, in the midst of the rebellious house thou art dwelling, that have eyes to see, and they have not seen; ears they have to hear, and they have not heard; for a rebellious house `are' they."
"26012003","26","12","3","And thou, son of man, make to thee vessels of removal, and remove by day before their eyes, and thou hast removed from thy place unto another place before their eyes, it may be they consider, for a rebellious house they `are'."
"26012004","26","12","4","And thou hast brought forth thy vessels as vessels of removal by day before their eyes, and thou, thou dost go forth at even before their eyes, as the goings forth of a removal."
"26012005","26","12","5","Before their eyes dig for thee through the wall, and thou hast brought forth by it."
"26012006","26","12","6","Before their eyes on the shoulder thou dost bear, in the darkness thou dost bring forth, thy face thou dost cover, and thou dost not see the earth, for a type I have given thee to the house of Israel.'"
"26012007","26","12","7","And I do so, as I have been commanded; my vessels I have brought forth as vessels of removal by day, and at even I have dug for me through the wall with the hand; in the darkness I have brought forth, on the shoulder I have borne away, before their eyes."
"26012008","26","12","8","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, in the morning, saying,"
"26012009","26","12","9","`Son of man, have they not said unto thee -- the house of Israel -- the rebellious house -- What art thou doing?"
"26012010","26","12","10","say unto them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: `The prince `is' this burden in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel who are in their midst."
"26012011","26","12","11","Say: I `am' your type; as I have done so it is done to them, into a removal, into a captivity, they do go."
"26012012","26","12","12","As to the prince who `is' in their midst, on the shoulder he beareth in the darkness, and he goeth forth, through the wall they dig to bring forth by it, his face he covereth, that he may not look on the very surface of the land."
"26012013","26","12","13","And I have spread My net for him, and he hath been caught in My snare, and I have brought him in to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, and it he doth not see -- and there doth he die."
"26012014","26","12","14","`And all who are round about him to help him, and all his bands, I do scatter to every wind, and a sword I draw out after them."
"26012015","26","12","15","And they have known that I `am' Jehovah, in My scattering them among nations, and I have spread them through lands;"
"26012016","26","12","16","and I have left of them, a few in number, from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence, so that they recount all their abominations among the nations whither they have come, and they have known that I `am' Jehovah.'"
"26012017","26","12","17","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,"
"26012018","26","12","18","`Son of man, thy bread in haste thou dost eat, and thy water with trembling and with fear thou dost drink;"
"26012019","26","12","19","and thou hast said unto the people of the land, Thus said the Lord Jehovah concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, concerning the land of Israel: Their bread with fear they do eat, and their water with astonishment drink, because its land is desolate, because of its fulness, because of the violence of all who are dwelling in it."
"26012020","26","12","20","And the cities that are inhabited are laid waste, and the land is a desolation, and ye have known that I `am' Jehovah.'"
"26012021","26","12","21","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,"
"26012022","26","12","22","`Son of man, what `is' this simile to you, concerning the land of Israel, saying, Prolonged are the days, and perished hath every vision?"
"26012023","26","12","23","therefore say unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I have caused this simile to cease, And they use it not as a simile again in Israel, But speak to them: Drawn near have the days, And spoken hath every vision."
"26012024","26","12","24","For there is no more any vain vision, and flattering divination, In the midst of the house of Israel."
"26012025","26","12","25","For I `am' Jehovah, I speak, The word that I speak -- it is done, It is not prolonged any more, For, in your days, O rebellious house, I speak a word, and I have done it, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.'"
"26012026","26","12","26","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:"
"26012027","26","12","27","`Son of man, lo, the house of Israel are saying, The vision that he is seeing `is' for many days, and of times far off he is prophesying,"
"26012028","26","12","28","therefore say unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: None of my words are prolonged any more, When I speak a word -- it is done, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah!'"
"26013001","26","13","1","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,"
"26013002","26","13","2","`Son of man, prophesy concerning the prophets of Israel who are prophesying, and thou hast said to those prophesying from their own heart: Hear ye a word of Jehovah:"
"26013003","26","13","3","Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo unto the prophets who are foolish, Who are going after their own spirit, And they have seen nothing."
"26013004","26","13","4","As foxes in the wastes, Thy prophets, O Israel, have been."
"26013005","26","13","5","Ye have not gone up into breaches, Nor do ye make a fence for the house of Israel, To stand in battle in a day of Jehovah."
"26013006","26","13","6","They have seen vanity, and lying divination, Who are saying: An affirmation of Jehovah, And Jehovah hath not sent them, And they have hoped to establish a word."
"26013007","26","13","7","A vain vision have ye not seen, And a lying divination spoken, When ye say: An affirmation of Jehovah, And I have not spoken?"
"26013008","26","13","8","Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen a lie, Therefore, lo, I `am' against you, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah."
"26013009","26","13","9","And My hand hath been on the prophets, Who are seeing vanity, and who are divining a lie, In the assembly of My people they are not, And in the writing of the house of Israel they are not written, And unto the ground of Israel they come not, And ye have known that I `am' the Lord Jehovah."
"26013010","26","13","10","Because, even because, they did cause My people to err, Saying, Peace! and there is no peace, And that one is building a wall, And lo, they are daubing it with chalk."
"26013011","26","13","11","Say to those daubing with chalk -- It falleth, There hath been an overflowing shower, And ye, O hailstones, do fall, And a tempestuous wind doth rend,"
"26013012","26","13","12","And lo, fallen hath the wall! Doth not one say unto you, Where `is' the daubing that ye daubed?"
"26013013","26","13","13","Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: I have rent with a tempestuous wind in My fury, And an overflowing shower is in Mine anger, And hailstones in My fury -- to consume."
"26013014","26","13","14","And I have broken down the wall that ye daubed with chalk, And have caused it to come unto the earth, And revealed hath been its foundation, And it hath fallen, And ye have been consumed in its midst, And ye have known that I `am' Jehovah."
"26013015","26","13","15","And I have completed My wrath on the wall, And on those daubing it with chalk, And I say to you: The wall is not, And those daubing it are not;"
"26013016","26","13","16","The prophets of Israel who are prophesying concerning Jerusalem, And who are seeing for her a vision of peace, And there is no peace, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah."
"26013017","26","13","17","And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, who are prophesying out of their own heart, and prophesy concerning them,"
"26013018","26","13","18","And thou hast said: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo to those sowing pillows for all joints of the arm, And to those making the kerchiefs For the head of every stature -- to hunt souls, The souls do ye hunt of My people? And the souls ye have do ye keep alive?"
"26013019","26","13","19","Yea, ye pierce Me concerning My people, For handfuls of barley, And for pieces of bread, to put to death Souls that should not die, And to keep alive souls that should not live, By your lying to My people -- hearkening to lies."
"26013020","26","13","20","Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I `am' against your pillows, With which ye are hunting there the souls of the flourishing, And I have rent them from off your arms, And have sent away the souls that ye are hunting, The souls of the flourishing."
"26013021","26","13","21","And I have torn your kerchiefs, And delivered My people out of your hand, And they are no more in your hand for a prey, And ye have known that I `am' Jehovah."
"26013022","26","13","22","Because of paining the heart of the righteous with falsehood, And I have not pained it, And strengthening the hands of the wicked, So as not to turn back from his evil way, To keep him alive,"
"26013023","26","13","23","Therefore, vanity ye do not see, And divination ye do not divine again, And I have delivered My people out of your hand, And ye have known that I `am' Jehovah!'"
"26014001","26","14","1","And come in unto me do certain of the elders of Israel, and sit before me."
"26014002","26","14","2","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,"
"26014003","26","14","3","`Son of man, these men have caused their idols to go up on their heart, and the stumbling-block of their iniquity they have put over-against their faces; am I inquired of at all by them?"
"26014004","26","14","4","`Therefore, speak with them, and thou hast said unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Every one of the house of Israel who causeth his idols to go up unto his heart, and the stumbling-block of his iniquity setteth over-against his face, and hath gone in unto the prophet -- I Jehovah have given an answer to him for this, for the abundance of his idols,"
"26014005","26","14","5","in order to catch the house of Israel by their heart, in that they have become estranged from off me by their idols -- all of them."
"26014006","26","14","6","`Therefore say unto the house of Israel: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Turn ye back, yea, turn ye back from your idols, and from all your abominations turn back your faces,"
"26014007","26","14","7","for every one of the house of Israel, and of the sojourners who doth sojourn in Israel, who is separated from after Me, and doth cause his idols to go up unto his heart, and the stumbling-block of his iniquity setteth over-against his face, and hath come in unto the prophet to inquire of him concerning Me, I, Jehovah, have answered him for Myself;"
"26014008","26","14","8","and I have set My face against that man, and made him for a sign, and for similes, and I have cut him off from the midst of My people, and ye have known that I `am' Jehovah."

"26017007","26","17","7","And there is another great eagle, Great-winged, and abounding with feathers, And lo, this vine hath bent its roots toward him, And its thin shoots it hath sent out toward him, To water it from the furrows of its planting,"
"26017008","26","17","8","On a good field, by many waters, it is planted, To make branches, and to bear fruit, To be for an goodly vine."
"26017009","26","17","9","Say: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: It prospereth -- its roots doth he not draw out, And its fruit cut off, and it is withered? `In' all the leaves of its springing it withereth, And not by great strength, and by a numerous people, To lift it up by its roots."
"26017010","26","17","10","And lo, the planted thing -- doth it prosper? When come against it doth the east wind, Doth it not utterly wither? On the furrows of its springing it withereth.'"

"26019007","26","19","7","And it knoweth his forsaken habitations, And their cities it hath laid waste, And desolate is the land and its fulness, Because of the voice of his roaring."
"26019008","26","19","8","And set against it do nations Round about from the provinces. And they spread out for it their net, In their pit it hath been caught."
"26019009","26","19","9","And they put it in prison -- in chains, And they bring it unto the king of Babylon, They bring it in unto bulwarks, So that its voice is not heard any more On mountains of Israel."

"26019012","26","19","12","And it is plucked up in fury, To the earth it hath been cast, And the east wind hath dried up its fruit, Broken and withered hath been the rod of its strength, Fire hath consumed it."
"26019013","26","19","13","And now -- it is planted in a wilderness, In a land dry and thirsty."
"26019014","26","19","14","And go forth doth fire from a rod of its boughs, Its fruit it hath devoured, And it hath no rod of strength -- a sceptre to rule, Lamentation it `is' -- and it is for a lamentation!'"

"26020006","26","20","6","In that day I did lift up My hand to them, To bring them forth from the land of Egypt, Unto a land that I spied out for them, Flowing with milk and honey, A beauty it `is' to all the lands,"

"26023016","26","23","16","And she doteth on them at the sight of her eyes, And sendeth messengers to them, to Chaldea."
"26023017","26","23","17","And come in unto her do sons of Babylon, To the bed of loves, And they defile her with their whoredoms, And she is defiled with them, And her soul is alienated from them."
"26023018","26","23","18","And she revealeth her whoredoms, And she revealeth her nakedness, And alienated is My soul from off her, As alienated was My soul from off her sister."
"26023019","26","23","19","And she multiplieth her whoredoms, To remember the days of her youth, When she went a-whoring in the land of Egypt."
"26023020","26","23","20","And she doteth on their paramours, Whose flesh `is' the flesh of asses, And the issue of horses -- their issue."
"26023021","26","23","21","Thou lookest after the wickedness of thy youth, In dealing out of Egypt thy loves, For the sake of the breasts of thy youth."
"26023022","26","23","22","Therefore, O Aholibah, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I am stirring up thy lovers against thee, From whom thy soul hath been alienated, And have brought them in against thee from round about."
"26023023","26","23","23","Sons of Babylon, and of all Chaldea, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, All the sons of Asshur with them, Desirable young men, governors and prefects, All of them -- rulers and proclaimed ones, Riding on horses, all of them."
"26023024","26","23","24","And they have come in against thee, With arms, rider, and wheel, And with an assembly of peoples; Target, and shield, and helmet, They do set against thee round about, And I have set before them judgment, They have judged thee in their Judgments."
"26023025","26","23","25","And I have set My jealousy against thee, And they have dealt with thee in fury, Thy nose and thine ears they turn aside, And thy posterity by sword falleth, They, thy sons and thy daughters do take away, And thy posterity is devoured by fire."
"26023026","26","23","26","And they have stripped thee of thy garments, And have taken thy beauteous jewels."
"26023027","26","23","27","And I have caused thy wickedness to cease from thee, And thy whoredoms out of the land of Egypt, And thou liftest not up thine eyes unto them, And Egypt thou dost not remember again."
"26023028","26","23","28","For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I am giving thee into a hand that thou hast hated, Into a hand from which thou wast alienated."
"26023029","26","23","29","And they have dealt with thee in hatred, And they have taken all thy labour, And they have left thee naked and bare, And revealed hath been the nakedness of thy whoredoms, And the wickedness of thy whoredoms."
"26023030","26","23","30","To do these things to thee, In thy going a-whoring after nations, Because thou hast been defiled with their idols,"
"26023031","26","23","31","In the way of thy sister thou hast walked, And I have given her cup into thy hand."
"26023032","26","23","32","Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The cup of thy sister thou dost drink, The deep and the wide one, (Thou art for laughter and for scorn,) Abundant to contain."
"26023033","26","23","33","With drunkenness and sorrow thou art filled, A cup of astonishment and desolation, The cup of thy sister Samaria."
"26023034","26","23","34","And thou hast drunk it, and hast drained `it', And its earthen ware thou dost gnaw, And thine own breasts thou pluckest off, For I have spoken, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah,"
"26023035","26","23","35","Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast forgotten Me, And thou dost cast Me behind thy back, Even thou also bear thy wickedness and thy whoredoms.'"
"26023036","26","23","36","And Jehovah saith unto me, `Son of man, Dost thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? Declare then to them their abominations."
"26023037","26","23","37","For they have committed adultery, And blood `is' in their hands, With their idols they committed adultery, And also their sons whom they bore to Me, They caused to pass over to them for food."
"26023038","26","23","38","Again, this they have done to Me, They defiled My sanctuary in that day, And My sabbaths they have polluted."
"26023039","26","23","39","And in their slaughtering their sons to their idols They also come in unto My sanctuary in that day to pollute it, And lo, thus they have done in the midst of My house,"
"26023040","26","23","40","And also that they send to men coming from afar, Unto whom a messenger is sent, And lo, they have come in for whom thou hast washed, Painted thine eyes, and put on adornment."
"26023041","26","23","41","And thou hast sat on a couch of honour, And a table arrayed before it, And My perfume and My oil placed on it."
"26023042","26","23","42","And the voice of a multitude at ease `is' with her, And unto men of the common people are brought in Sabeans from the wilderness, And they put bracelets on their hands, And a beauteous crown on their heads."
"26023043","26","23","43","And I say of the worn-out one in adulteries, Now they commit her whoredoms -- she also!"
"26023044","26","23","44","And they come in unto her, As the coming in unto a whorish woman, So they have come in unto Aholah, And unto Aholibah -- the wicked women."
"26023045","26","23","45","As to righteous men, they judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, And the judgment of women shedding blood, For they `are' adulteresses, And blood `is' in their hands."
"26023046","26","23","46","For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Bring up against them an assembly, And give them to trembling and to spoiling."
"26023047","26","23","47","And they have cast at them the stone of the assembly, And cut them with their swords, Their sons and their daughters they do slay, And their houses with fire they burn."
"26023048","26","23","48","And I have caused wickedness to cease from the land, And instructed have been all the women, And they do not according to your wickedness."
"26023049","26","23","49","And they have put your wickedness on you, And the sins of your idols ye bear, And ye have known that I `am' the Lord Jehovah!"
"26024001","26","24","1","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth of the month, saying,"
"26024002","26","24","2","`Son of man, write for thee the name of the day -- this self-same day leaned hath the king of Babylon toward Jerusalem in this self-same day --"
"26024003","26","24","3","and use unto the rebellious house a simile, and thou hast said unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: To set on the pot, to set `it' on, and also to pour into it water,"
"26024004","26","24","4","To gather its pieces unto it, every good piece, Thigh and shoulder, the choice of the bones to fill in."
"26024005","26","24","5","The choice of the flock to take, And also to pile of the bones under it, Boil it thoroughly, yea, cook its bones in its midst."
"26024006","26","24","6","Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo `to' the city of blood, A pot whose scum `is' in it, And its scum hath not come out of it, By piece of it, by piece of it bring it out, Not fallen on it hath a lot."
"26024007","26","24","7","For her blood in her midst hath been, On a clear place of a rock she hath set it, She hath not poured it on the earth, To cover it over with dust."
"26024008","26","24","8","To cause fury to come up to take vengeance, I have put her blood on a clear place of a rock -- not to be covered."
"26024009","26","24","9","Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo `to' the city of blood, yea, I -- I make great the pile."
"26024010","26","24","10","Make abundant the wood, Kindle the fire, consume the flesh, And make the compound, And let the bones be burnt."
"26024011","26","24","11","And cause it to stand on its coals empty, So that its brass is hot and burning, Melted hath been in its midst its uncleanness, Consumed is its scum."
"26024012","26","24","12","`With' sorrows she hath wearied herself, And the abundance of her scum goeth not out of her, In the fire `is' her scum."
"26024013","26","24","13","In thine uncleanness `is' wickedness, Because I have cleansed thee, And thou hast not been cleansed, From thine uncleanness thou art not cleansed again, Till I have caused My fury to rest on thee."
"26024014","26","24","14","I, Jehovah, hath spoken, It hath come, and I have done `it', I do not free, nor do I spare, nor do I repent, According to thy ways, and according to thine acts, they have judged thee, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.'"
"26024015","26","24","15","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,"
"26024016","26","24","16","`Son of man, lo, I am taking from thee the desire of thine eyes by a stroke, and thou dost not mourn, nor weep, nor let thy tear come."
"26024017","26","24","17","Cease to groan, `for' the dead thou dost make no mourning, thy bonnet bind on thee, and thy shoes thou dost put on thy feet, and thou dost not cover over the upper lip, and bread of men thou dost not eat.'"
"26024018","26","24","18","And I speak unto the people in the morning, and my wife dieth in the evening, and I do in the morning as I have been commanded."

"26024023","26","24","23","And your bonnets `are' on your heads, And your shoes `are' on your feet, Ye do not mourn nor do ye weep, And ye have wasted away for your iniquities, And ye have howled one unto another."
"26024024","26","24","24","And Ezekiel hath been to you for a type, According to all that he hath done ye do; In its coming in -- ye have known that I `am' the Lord Jehovah."
"26024025","26","24","25","And thou, son of man, Is it not in the day of My taking from them their strength, The joy of their beauty, the desire of their eyes, And the song of their soul, Their sons and their daughters?"
"26024026","26","24","26","In that day come doth the escaped one to thee. To cause the ears to hear."

"26025001","26","25","1","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,"
"26025002","26","25","2","`Son of man, set thy face unto the sons of Ammon, and prophesy against them;"
"26025003","26","25","3","and thou hast said to the sons of Ammon: Hear ye a word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of thy saying, Aha, to My sanctuary, Because it hath been polluted, And unto the ground of Israel, Because it hath been desolate, And unto the house of Judah, Because they have gone into a removal:"
"26025004","26","25","4","Therefore, lo, I am giving thee to sons of the east for a possession, And they set their towers in thee, And have placed in thee their tabernacles. They eat thy fruit, and they drink thy milk,"
"26025005","26","25","5","And I have given Rabbah for a habitation of camels, And the sons of Ammon for the crouching of a flock, And ye have known that I `am' Jehovah."
"26025006","26","25","6","For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of thy clapping the hand, And of thy stamping with the foot, And thou rejoicest with all thy despite in soul Against the ground of Israel,"
"26025007","26","25","7","Therefore, lo, I -- I have stretched out My hand against thee, And have given thee for a portion to nations, And I have cut thee off from the peoples, And caused thee to perish from the lands; I destroy thee, and thou hast known that I `am' Jehovah."
"26025008","26","25","8","Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of the saying of Moab and Seir: Lo, as all the nations `is' the house of Judah;"
"26025009","26","25","9","Therefore, lo, I am opening the shoulder of Moab -- From the cities -- from his cities -- from his frontier, The beauty of the land, Beth-Jeshimoth, Baal-Meon, and Kiriathaim,"
"26025010","26","25","10","To the sons of the east, with the sons of Ammon, And I have given it for a possession, So that the sons of Ammon are not remembered among nations."
"26025011","26","25","11","And in Moab I do judgments, And they have known that I `am' Jehovah."
"26025012","26","25","12","Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of the doings of Edom, In taking vengeance on the house of Judah, Yea, they are very guilty, And they have taken vengeance on them."
"26025013","26","25","13","Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: I have stretched out My hand against Edom, And I have cut off from it man and beast, And given it up -- a waste, from Teman even to Dedan, By sword they do fall."
"26025014","26","25","14","And I have given My vengeance on Edom, By the hand of My people Israel, And they have done in Edom, According to My anger, and according to My fury, And they have known My vengeance, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah."
"26025015","26","25","15","Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of the doings of the Philistines in vengeance, And they take vengeance with despite in soul, To destroy -- the enmity age-during!"

"26026012","26","26","12","And they have spoiled thy wealth, And they have plundered thy merchandise, And they have thrown down thy walls, And thy desirable houses they break down, And thy stones, and thy wood, and thy dust, In the midst of the waters they place."
"26026013","26","26","13","And I have caused the noise of thy songs to cease, And the voice of thy harps is heard no more."
"26026014","26","26","14","And I have given thee up for a clear place of a rock, A spreading-place of nets thou art, Thou art not built up any more, For I, Jehovah, I have spoken, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah."

"26028011","26","28","11","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:"
"26028012","26","28","12","`Son of man, lift up a lamentation for the king of Tyre, And thou hast said to him: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Thou art sealing up a measurement, Full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty."
"26028013","26","28","13","In Eden, the garden of God, thou hast been, Every precious stone thy covering, Ruby, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, Sapphire, emerald, and carbuncle, and gold, The workmanship of thy tabrets, and of thy pipes, In thee in the day of thy being produced, have been prepared."
"26028014","26","28","14","Thou `art' an anointed cherub who is covering, And I have set thee in the holy mount, God thou hast been, In the midst of stones of fire thou hast walked up and down."
"26028015","26","28","15","Perfect `art' thou in thy ways, From the day of thy being produced, Till perversity hath been found in thee."
"26028016","26","28","16","By the abundance of thy merchandise They have filled thy midst with violence, And thou dost sin, And I thrust thee from the mount of God, And I destroy thee, O covering cherub, From the midst of the stones of fire."
"26028017","26","28","17","High hath been thy heart, because of thy beauty, Thou hast corrupted thy wisdom because of thy brightness, On the earth I have cast thee, Before kings I have set thee, to look on thee,"
"26028018","26","28","18","From the abundance of thy iniquity, By the perversity of thy traffic, Thou hast polluted thy sanctuaries, And I bring forth fire from thy midst, It hath devoured thee, And I make thee become ashes on the earth, Before the eyes of all beholding thee."

"26028025","26","28","25","Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In My gathering the house of Israel, Out of the peoples among whom they were scattered, I have been sanctified in them, Before the eyes of the nations, And they have dwelt on their ground, That I gave to My servant, to Jacob,"
"26028026","26","28","26","And they have dwelt on it confidently, And builded houses, and planted vineyards, And dwelt confidently -- in My doing judgments, On all those despising them round about, And they have known that I, Jehovah, `am' their God!'"
"26029001","26","29","1","In the tenth year, in the tenth `month', in the twelfth of the month, hath a word of Jehovah been unto me, saying,"

"26029003","26","29","3","Speak, and thou hast said: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I `am' against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt! The great dragon that is crouching in the midst of his floods, Who hath said, My flood `is' my own, And I -- I have made it `for' myself."
"26029004","26","29","4","And I have put hooks in thy jaws, And I have caused the fish of thy floods to cleave to thy scales, And I have caused thee to come up from the midst of thy floods, And every fish of thy floods to thy scales doth cleave."
"26029005","26","29","5","And I have left thee in the wilderness, Thou and every fish of thy floods, On the face of the field thou dost fall, Thou art not gathered nor assembled, To the beast of the earth and to the fowl of the heavens I have given thee for food."
"26029006","26","29","6","And known have all inhabitants of Egypt That I `am' Jehovah, Because of their being a staff of reed to the house of Israel."
"26029007","26","29","7","In their taking hold of thee by thy hand, -- thou art crushed, And hast rent to them all the shoulder, And in their leaning on thee thou art broken, And hast caused all their thighs to stand."
"26029008","26","29","8","Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I am bringing in against thee a sword, And have cut off from thee man and beast."
"26029009","26","29","9","And the land of Egypt hath been for a desolation and a waste, And they have known that I `am' Jehovah. Because he said: The flood `is' mine, and I made `it'."
"26029010","26","29","10","Therefore, lo, I `am' against thee, and against thy floods, And have given the land of Egypt for wastes, A waste, a desolation, from Migdol to Syene, And unto the border of Cush."
"26029011","26","29","11","Not pass over into it doth a foot of man, Yea, the foot of beast doth not pass into it, Nor is it inhabited forty years."
"26029012","26","29","12","And I have made the land of Egypt a desolation, In the midst of desolate lands, And its cities, in the midst of waste cities, Are a desolation forty years, And I have scattered the Egyptians among nations, And I have dispersed them through lands."
"26029013","26","29","13","But thus said the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years I gather the Egyptians Out of the peoples whither they have been scattered,"

"26031003","26","31","3","Lo, Asshur, a cedar in Lebanon, Fair in branch, and shading bough, and high in stature, And between thickets hath its foliage been."
"26031004","26","31","4","Waters have made it great, The deep hath exalted him with its flowings, Going round about its planting, And its conduits it hath sent forth unto all trees of the field."
"26031005","26","31","5","Therefore higher hath been his stature than all trees of the field, And multiplied are his boughs, and long are his branches, Because of many waters in his shooting forth,"

"26033020","26","33","20","And ye have said: The way of the Lord is not pondered, Each according to his ways do I judge you, O house of Israel.'"
"26033021","26","33","21","And it cometh to pass, in the twelfth year -- in the tenth `month', in the fifth of the month -- of our removal, come in unto me doth one who is escaped from Jerusalem, saying, `The city hath been smitten.'"
"26033022","26","33","22","And the hand of Jehovah hath been unto me in the evening, before the coming in of the escaped one, and He openeth my mouth till the coming in unto me in the morning, and opened is my mouth, and I have not been silent again."
"26033023","26","33","23","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,"
"26033024","26","33","24","`Son of man, the inhabitants of these wastes on the ground of Israel are speaking, saying: Alone hath been Abraham -- and he possesseth the land, and we `are' many -- to us hath the land been given for a possession."
"26033025","26","33","25","Therefore say unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: With the blood ye do eat, And your eyes ye lift up unto your idols, And blood ye shed, and the land ye inherit!"
"26033026","26","33","26","Ye have stood on your sword, Ye have done abomination, Each the wife of his neighbour ye have defiled, And the land ye possess!"
"26033027","26","33","27","Thus dost thou say unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I live -- do not they who `are' in the wastes by the sword fall? And they who `are' on the face of the field, To the beast I have given for food, And they who are in strongholds and in caves by pestilence die."
"26033028","26","33","28","And I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, And ceased hath the excellency of its strength, And desolated have been mountains of Israel, Without any one passing through."
"26033029","26","33","29","And they have known that I `am' Jehovah, In My making the land a desolation and an astonishment, For all their abominations that they have done."
"26033030","26","33","30","And thou, son of man, the sons of thy people who are speaking about thee, By the walls, and in openings of the houses, Have spoken one with another, each with his brother, Saying: Come in, I pray you, And hear what `is' the word that cometh out from Jehovah."
"26033031","26","33","31","And they come in unto thee as the coming in of a people, And they sit before thee -- My people, And have heard thy words, and they do them not, For doting loves with their mouth they are making, After their dishonest gain their heart is going."
"26033032","26","33","32","And lo, thou `art' to them as a singer of doting loves, A pleasant voice, and playing well on an instrument, And they have heard thy words, and they are not doing them."
"26033033","26","33","33","And in its coming in -- lo, it hath come, And they have known that a prophet hath been in their midst!'"
"26034001","26","34","1","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,"
"26034002","26","34","2","`Son of man, prophesy concerning shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and thou hast said unto them: To the shepherds, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo `to' the shepherds of Israel, Who have been feeding themselves! The flock do not the shepherds feed?"
"26034003","26","34","3","The fat ye do eat, and the wool ye put on, The fed one ye slaughter, the flock ye feed not."
"26034004","26","34","4","The weak ye have not strengthened, And the sick one ye have not healed, And the broken ye have not bound up, And the driven away have not brought back, And the lost ye have not sought, And with might ye have ruled them and with rigour."
"26034005","26","34","5","And they are scattered from want of a shepherd, And are for food to every beast of the field, Yea, they are scattered."
"26034006","26","34","6","Go astray do My flock on all the mountains, And on every high hill, And on all the face of the land have My flock been scattered, And there is none inquiring, and none seeking."
"26034007","26","34","7","Therefore, shepherds, hear a word of Jehovah:"
"26034008","26","34","8","I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, If not, because of My flock being for a prey, Yea, My flock is for food to every beast of the field, Because there is no shepherd, And My shepherds have not sought My flock, And the shepherds do feed themselves, And My flock they have not fed."
"26034009","26","34","9","Therefore, O shepherds, hear a word of Jehovah:"
"26034010","26","34","10","Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I `am' against the shepherds, And have required My flock from their hand, And caused them to cease from feeding the flock, And no more do the shepherds feed themselves, And I have delivered My flock from their mouth, And they are not to them for food."
"26034011","26","34","11","For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I -- even I, have required My flock, And I have sought it out."
"26034012","26","34","12","As a shepherd's searching of his drove, In the day of his being in the midst of his scattered flock, so I do seek My flock, And have delivered them out of all places, Whither they have been scattered, In a day of cloud and thick darkness."
"26034013","26","34","13","And brought them out from the peoples, And have gathered them from the lands, And brought them unto their own ground, And have fed them on mountains of Israel, By streams, and by all dwellings of the land."
"26034014","26","34","14","With good pasture I do feed them, And on mountains of the high place of Israel is their habitation, There do they lie down in a good habitation, And fat pastures they enjoy on mountains of Israel."
"26034015","26","34","15","I feed My flock, and cause them to lie down, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah."
"26034016","26","34","16","The lost I seek, and the driven away bring back, And the broken I bind up, and the sick I strengthen, And the fat and the strong I destroy, I feed it with judgment."
"26034017","26","34","17","And you, My flock, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I am judging between sheep and sheep, Between rams and he-goats."
"26034018","26","34","18","Is it a little thing for you -- the good pasture ye enjoy, And the remnant of your pasture ye tread down with your feet, And a depth of waters ye do drink, And the remainder with your feet ye trample,"
"26034019","26","34","19","And My flock the trodden thing of your feet consumeth, And the trampled thing of your feet drinketh?"
"26034020","26","34","20","Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah to them: Lo, I -- even I, have judged between fat sheep and lean sheep."
"26034021","26","34","21","Because with side and with shoulder ye thrust away, And with your horns push all the diseased, Till ye have scattered them to the out-place,"
"26034022","26","34","22","And I have given safety to My flock, And they are not any more for prey, And I have judged between sheep and sheep."
"26034023","26","34","23","And have raised up over them one shepherd, And he hath fed them -- my servant David, He doth feed them, and he is their shepherd,"
"26034024","26","34","24","And I, Jehovah, I am their God, And My servant David prince in their midst, I, Jehovah, have spoken."
"26034025","26","34","25","And I have made for them a covenant of peace, And caused evil beasts to cease out of the land, And they have dwelt in a wilderness confidently, And they have slept in forests."
"26034026","26","34","26","And I have given them, and the suburbs of my hill, a blessing, And caused the shower to come down in its season, Showers of blessing they are."
"26034027","26","34","27","And given hath the tree of the field its fruit, And the land doth give her increase, And they have been on their land confident, And they have known that I `am' Jehovah, In My breaking the bands of their yoke, And I have delivered them from the hand of those laying service on them."
"26034028","26","34","28","And they are no more a prey to nations, And the beast of the earth devoureth them not, And they have dwelt confidently, And there is none troubling."
"26034029","26","34","29","And I have raised for them a plant for renown, And they are no more consumed by hunger in the land, And they bear no more the shame of the nations."
"26034030","26","34","30","And they have known that I, Jehovah, their God, `am' with them, And they -- the house of Israel -- My people, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah."
"26034031","26","34","31","And ye, My flock, the flock of My pasture, Men ye `are' -- I `am' your God, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah!'"
"26035001","26","35","1","And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:"
"26035002","26","35","2","`Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,"
"26035003","26","35","3","and thou hast said to it: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I `am' against thee, O mount Seir, And have stretched out My hand against thee, And made thee a desolation and an astonishment."
"26035004","26","35","4","Thy cities a waste I make, and thou art a desolation, And thou hast known that I `am' Jehovah."
"26035005","26","35","5","Because of thy having an enmity age-during, And thou dost saw the sons of Israel, By the hands of the sword, In the time of their calamity, In the time of the iniquity of the end:"
"26035006","26","35","6","Therefore, I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, Surely for blood I do appoint thee, And blood doth pursue thee, If blood thou hast not hated, Blood also doth pursue thee."
"26035007","26","35","7","And I have given mount Seir for a desolation and an astonishment, And have cut off from it him who is passing over and him who is returning,"

"26035011","26","35","11","Therefore, I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, And I have done according to thine anger, And according to thine envy, With which thou hast wrought, Because of thy hatred against them, And I have been known among them when I judge thee."
"26035012","26","35","12","And thou hast known that I -- Jehovah, I have heard all thy despisings that thou hast spoken Against mountains of Israel, saying: A desolation, to us they were given for food."
"26035013","26","35","13","And ye magnify yourselves against Me with your mouth, And have made abundant against Me your words, I -- I have heard."
"26035014","26","35","14","Thus said the Lord Jehovah: According to the rejoicing of the whole land, A desolation I make of thee."
"26035015","26","35","15","According to thy joy at the inheritance of the house of Israel because of desolation, So I do to thee -- a desolation thou art, O mount Seir, and all Edom -- all of it, And they have known that I `am' Jehovah!"
"26036001","26","36","1","And thou, son of man, prophesy unto mountains of Israel, and thou hast said, O mountains of Israel, hear a word of Jehovah."
"26036002","26","36","2","Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy said against you, Aha, and the high places of old for a possession have been to us,"

"26036004","26","36","4","Therefore, O mountains of Israel, Hear a word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus said the Lord Jehovah, to mountains, and to hills, To streams, and to valleys, And to wastes that `are' desolate, And to cities that are forsaken, That have been for a prey, And for a scorn, to the remnant of the nations who `are' round about."
"26036005","26","36","5","Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Have I not, in the fire of My jealousy, Spoken against the remnant of the nations, And against Edom -- all of it, Who gave My land to themselves for a possession, With the joy of the whole heart -- with despite of soul, For the sake of casting it out for a prey?"
"26036006","26","36","6","Therefore, prophesy concerning the ground of Israel, And thou hast said to mountains, and to hills, To streams, and to valleys, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I, in My jealousy, and in My fury, I have spoken, Because the shame of nations ye have borne."

"26036023","26","36","23","And I have sanctified My great name, That is profaned among nations, That ye have polluted in your midst, And known have the nations that I `am' Jehovah, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, In My being sanctified in you before your eyes."
"26036024","26","36","24","And I have taken you out of the nations, And have gathered you out of all the lands, And I have brought you in unto your land,"

"26036026","26","36","26","And I have given to you a new heart, And a new spirit I give in your midst, And I have turned aside the heart of stone out of your flesh, And I have given to you a heart of flesh."
"26036027","26","36","27","And My Spirit I give in your midst, And I have done this, so that in My statutes ye walk, And My judgments ye keep, and have done them."

"26038012","26","38","12","To take a spoil, and to take a prey, To turn back thy hand on inhabited wastes, And on a people gathered out of nations, Making cattle and substance, Dwelling on a high part of the land."
"26038013","26","38","13","Sheba, and Dedan, and merchants of Tarshish, And all its young lions say to thee: To take a spoil art thou come in? To take a prey assembled thine assembly? To bear away silver and gold? To take away cattle and substance? To take a great spoil?"
"26038014","26","38","14","Therefore, prophesy, son of man, and thou hast said to Gog: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In that day, in the dwelling of My people Israel safely, Dost thou not know?"
"26038015","26","38","15","And thou hast come in out of thy place, From the sides of the north, Thou and many peoples with thee, Riding on horses -- all of them, A great assembly, and a numerous force."
"26038016","26","38","16","And thou hast come up against My people Israel, As a cloud to cover the land, In the latter end of the days it is, And I have brought thee in against My land, In order that the nations may know Me, In My being sanctified in thee before their eyes, O Gog."
"26038017","26","38","17","Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Art thou he of whom I spake in former days, By the hand of My servants, prophets of Israel, Who are prophesying in those days -- years, To bring thee in against them?"
"26038018","26","38","18","And it hath come to pass, in that day, In the day of the coming in of Gog against the land of Israel, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, Come up doth My fury in My face,"
"26038019","26","38","19","And in My zeal, in the fire of My wrath, I have spoken: Is there not in that day a great rushing on the land of Israel?"
"26038020","26","38","20","And rushed from My presence have fishes of the sea, And the fowl of the heavens, And the beast of the field, And every creeping thing that is creeping on the ground, And all men who `are' on the face of the ground, And thrown down have been the mountains, And fallen have the ascents, And every wall to the earth falleth."
"26038021","26","38","21","And I have called against him, to all My mountains a sword, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, The sword of each is against his brother."
"26038022","26","38","22","And I have been judged with him, With pestilence and with blood, And an overflowing rain and hailstones, Fire and brimstone I rain on him, and on his bands, And on many peoples who `are' with him."
"26038023","26","38","23","And I have magnified Myself, and sanctified Myself, And I have been known before the eyes of many nations, And they have known that I `am' Jehovah!"
"26039001","26","39","1","And thou, son of man, prophesy concerning Gog, and thou hast said: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I `am' against thee, O Gog, Prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal,"
"26039002","26","39","2","And have turned thee back, and enticed thee, And caused thee to come up from the sides of the north, And brought thee in against mountains of Israel,"
"26039003","26","39","3","And have smitten thy bow out of thy left hand, Yea, thine arrows out of thy right I cause to fall."
"26039004","26","39","4","On mountains of Israel thou fallest, Thou, and all thy bands, and the peoples who `are' with thee, To ravenous fowl -- a bird of every wing, And `to' a beast of the field, I have given thee for food."
"26039005","26","39","5","On the face of the field thou fallest, for I have spoken, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah."
"26039006","26","39","6","And I have sent a fire against Magog, And against the confident inhabitants of the isles, And they have known that I `am' Jehovah."
"26039007","26","39","7","And My holy name I make known in the midst of My people Israel, And I pollute not My holy name any more, And known have the nations that I, Jehovah, the Holy One, `am' in Israel."
"26039008","26","39","8","Lo, it hath come, and it hath been done, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, It `is' the day of which I spake."
"26039009","26","39","9","And gone out have the inhabitants of cities of Israel, And they have burned and kindled `a fire', With armour, and shield, and buckler, With bow, and with arrows, And with hand-staves, and with javelins, And they have caused a fire to burn with them seven years,"
"26039010","26","39","10","And they do not take wood out of the field, Nor do they hew out of the forests, For with armour they cause the fire to burn, And they have spoiled their spoilers, And they have plundered their plunderers, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah."
"26039011","26","39","11","And it hath come to pass, in that day, I give to Gog a place there -- a grave in Israel, the valley of those passing by, east of the sea, and it is stopping those passing by, and they have buried there Gog, and all his multitude, and have cried, O valley of the multitude of Gog!"
"26039012","26","39","12","And the house of Israel have buried them -- in order to cleanse the land -- seven months."
"26039013","26","39","13","Yea, all the people of the land have buried them, and it hath been to them for a name -- the day of My being honoured -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah."
"26039014","26","39","14","And men for continual employment they separate, passing on through the land, burying with those passing by those who are left on the face of the earth, to cleanse it: at the end of seven months they search."
"26039015","26","39","15","And those passing by have passed through the land, and seen a bone of man, and one hath constructed near it a sign till those burying have buried it in the valley of the multitude of Gog."
"26039016","26","39","16","And also the name of the city `is' The multitude; and they have cleansed the land."
"26039017","26","39","17","And thou, son of man, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Say to the bird -- every wing, and to every beast of the field: Be assembled and come in, Be gathered from round about, For My sacrifice that I am sacrificing for you, A great sacrifice on mountains of Israel, And ye have eaten flesh, and drunk blood."
"26039018","26","39","18","Flesh of the mighty ye do eat, And blood of princes of the earth ye drink, Of rams, of lambs, and of he-goats, Of calves, fatlings of Bashan -- all of them."
"26039019","26","39","19","And ye have eaten fat to satiety, And ye have drunk blood -- to drunkenness, Of My sacrifice that I sacrificed for you."
"26039020","26","39","20","And ye have been satisfied at My table with horse and rider, Mighty man, and every man of war, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah."
"26039021","26","39","21","And I have given My honour among nations, And seen have all the nations My Judgment that I have done, And My hand that I have laid on them."
"26039022","26","39","22","And known have the house of Israel that I `am' Jehovah their God, From that day and henceforth."
"26039023","26","39","23","And known have the nations that for their iniquity, Removed have the house of Israel, Because they have trespassed against Me, And I do hide My face from them, And give them into the hand of their adversaries, And they fall by sword -- all of them."
"26039024","26","39","24","According to their uncleanness, And according to their transgressions, I have done with them, And I do hide My face from them."
"26039025","26","39","25","Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Now do I bring back the captivity of Jacob, And I have pitied all the house of Israel, And have been zealous for My holy name."
"26039026","26","39","26","And they have forgotten their shame, And all their trespass that they trespassed against Me, In their dwelling on their land confidently and none troubling."
"26039027","26","39","27","In My bringing them back from the peoples, I have assembled them from the lands of their enemies, And I have been sanctified in them before the eyes of the many nations,"
"26039028","26","39","28","And they have known that I `am' Jehovah their God, In My removing them unto the nations, And I have gathered them unto their land, And I leave none of them any more there."
"26039029","26","39","29","And I hide not any more My face from them, In that I have poured out My spirit on the house of Israel, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah!'"
"26040001","26","40","1","In the twenty and fifth year of our removal, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in this self-same day hath a hand of Jehovah been upon me, and He bringeth me in thither;"
"26040002","26","40","2","in visions of God He hath brought me in unto the land of Israel, and causeth me to rest on a very high mountain, and upon it `is' as the frame of a city on the south."
"26040003","26","40","3","And He bringeth me in thither, and lo, a man, his appearance as the appearance of brass, and a thread of flax in his hand, and a measuring-reed, and he is standing at the gate,"

"26042017","26","42","17","He hath measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about."
"26042018","26","42","18","The south side he hath measured, five hundred reeds, with the measuring-reed."
"26042019","26","42","19","He hath turned round unto the west side, he hath measured five hundred reeds with the measuring-reed."
"26042020","26","42","20","At the four sides he hath measured it, a wall `is' to it all round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to separate between the holy and the profane place."
"26043001","26","43","1","And he causeth me to go to the gate, the gate that is looking eastward."
"26043002","26","43","2","And lo, the honour of the God of Israel hath come from the way of the east, and His voice `is' as the noise of many waters, and the earth hath shone from His honour."
"26043003","26","43","3","And according to the appearance `is' the appearance that I saw, as the appearance that I saw in my coming in to destroy the city, and the appearances `are' as the appearance that I saw at the river Chebar, and I fall on my face."
"26043004","26","43","4","And the honour of Jehovah hath come in unto the house, the way of the gate whose face `is' eastward."
"26043005","26","43","5","And take me up doth the Spirit, and bringeth me in unto the inner court, and lo, the honour of Jehovah hath filled the house."
"26043006","26","43","6","And I hear one speaking unto me from the house, and a man hath been standing near me,"
"26043007","26","43","7","and He saith unto me: `Son of man, the place of My throne, And the place of the soles of My feet, Where I dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel to the age, Defile no more do the house of Israel My holy name, They, and their kings, by their whoredom, And by the carcases of their kings -- their high places."
"26043008","26","43","8","In their putting their threshold with My threshold, And their door-post near My door-post, And the wall between Me and them, And they have defiled My holy name, By their abominations that they have done, And I consume them in Mine anger."
"26043009","26","43","9","Now do they put far off their whoredom, And the carcases of their kings -- from Me, And I have dwelt in their midst to the age."
"26043010","26","43","10","Thou, son of man, Shew the house of Israel the house, And they are ashamed of their iniquities, And they have measured the measurement."
"26043011","26","43","11","And since they have been ashamed of all that they have done, The form of the house, and its measurement, And its outlets, and its inlets, and all its forms, And all its statutes, even all its forms, And all its laws cause them to know, And write `it' before their eyes, And they observe all its forms, And all its statutes, and have done them."
"26043012","26","43","12","This `is' a law of the house: on the top of the mountain, all its border all round about `is' most holy; lo, this `is' a law of the house."
"26043013","26","43","13","`And these `are' measures of the altar by cubits: The cubit `is' a cubit and a handbreadth, and the centre `is' a cubit, and a cubit the breadth; and its border on its edge round about `is' one span, and this `is' the upper part of the altar."
"26043014","26","43","14","And from the centre of the ground unto the lower border `is' two cubits, and the breadth one cubit, and from the lesser border unto the greater border four cubits, and the breadth a cubit."
"26043015","26","43","15","`And the altar `is' four cubits, and from the altar and upward `are' four horns."
"26043016","26","43","16","And the altar `is' twelve long by twelve broad, square in its four squares."
"26043017","26","43","17","And the border `is' fourteen long by fourteen broad, at its four squares, and the border round about it `is' half a cubit, and the centre to it `is' a cubit round about, and its steps are looking eastward.'"
"26043018","26","43","18","And He saith unto me, `Son of man, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: These `are' statutes of the altar in the day of its being made to cause burnt-offering to go up on it, and to sprinkle on it blood."
"26043019","26","43","19","And thou hast given unto the priests, the Levites, who `are' of the seed of Zadok -- who are near unto Me, an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, to serve Me -- a calf from the herd, for a sin-offering."
"26043020","26","43","20","And thou hast taken of its blood, and hast put it on its four horns, and on the four corners of its border, and on the border round about, and hast cleansed it, and purified it."
"26043021","26","43","21","And thou hast taken the bullock of the sin-offering, and hast burnt it in the appointed place of the house at the outside of the sanctuary."
"26043022","26","43","22","And on the second day thou dost bring near a kid of the goats, a perfect one, for a sin-offering, and they have cleansed the altar, as they cleansed `it' for the bullock."
"26043023","26","43","23","In thy finishing cleansing, thou dost bring near a calf, a son of the herd, a perfect one, and a ram out of the flock, a perfect one."
"26043024","26","43","24","And thou hast brought them near before Jehovah, and the priests have cast upon them salt, and have caused them to go up, a burnt-offering to Jehovah."
"26043025","26","43","25","Seven days thou dost prepare a goat for a sin-offering daily, and a bullock, a son of the herd, and a ram out of the flock, perfect ones, do they prepare."
"26043026","26","43","26","Seven days they purify the altar, and have cleansed it, and filled their hand."
"26043027","26","43","27","And the days are completed, and it hath come to pass on the eighth day, and henceforth, the priests prepare on the altar your burnt-offerings and your peace-offerings, and I have accepted you -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.'"
"26044001","26","44","1","And he causeth me to turn back the way of the gate of the outer sanctuary that is looking eastward, and it is shut."
"26044002","26","44","2","And Jehovah saith unto me, `This gate is shut, it is not opened, and none doth go in by it, for Jehovah, God of Israel, hath come in by it, and it hath been shut."
"26044003","26","44","3","The prince, who `is' prince, he sitteth by it to eat bread before Jehovah, by the way of the porch of the gate he cometh in, and by its way he goeth out.'"
"26044004","26","44","4","And he bringeth me in the way of the north gate unto the front of the house, and I look, and lo, filled hath the honour of Jehovah the house of Jehovah, and I fall on my face."
"26044005","26","44","5","And Jehovah saith unto me, `Son of man, set thy heart, and see with thine eyes, and with thine ears hear, all that I am speaking with thee, of all the statutes of the house of Jehovah, and of all its laws; and thou hast set thy heart to the entrance of the house, with all the outlets of the sanctuary,"
"26044006","26","44","6","and hast said unto the rebellious, unto the house of Israel: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Enough to you -- of all your abominations, O house of Israel."
"26044007","26","44","7","In your bringing in sons of a stranger, uncircumcised of heart, and uncircumcised of flesh, to be in My sanctuary, to pollute it, even My house, in your bringing near My bread, fat, and blood, and they break My covenant by all your abominations,"
"26044008","26","44","8","and ye have not kept the charge of My holy things, and ye set `them' for keepers of My charge in My sanctuary for you."
"26044009","26","44","9","`Thus said the Lord Jehovah: No son of a stranger, uncircumcised of heart, and uncircumcised of flesh, cometh in unto My sanctuary, even any son of a stranger, who `is' in the midst of the sons of Israel,"
"26044010","26","44","10","but -- the Levites who have gone far off from me, in the wandering of Israel when they went astray from Me after their idols, and they have borne their iniquity."
"26044011","26","44","11","And they have been in My sanctuary ministrants, overseers at the gates of the house, and ministrants at the house; they slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they stand before them to serve them."
"26044012","26","44","12","Because that they serve them before their idols, and have been to the house of Israel for a stumbling-block of iniquity, therefore I have lifted up my hand against them -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah -- and they have borne their iniquity."
"26044013","26","44","13","And they draw not nigh unto Me to act as My priest, and to draw nigh unto any of My holy things, unto the holy of holies, and they have borne their shame and their abominations that they have done,"
"26044014","26","44","14","and I made them keepers of the charge of the house, for all its service and for all that is done in it."
"26044015","26","44","15","`And the priests, the Levites, sons of Zadok, who have kept the charge of My sanctuary in the wandering of the sons of Israel from off Me, they draw near unto Me to serve Me, and have stood before Me, to bring near to Me fat and blood -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah:"
"26044016","26","44","16","they come in unto My sanctuary, and they draw near unto My table to serve Me, and they have kept My charge."
"26044017","26","44","17","And it hath come to pass, in their going in unto the gates of the inner court, linen garments they put on; and no wool cometh up on them in their ministering in the gates of the inner court and within."
"26044018","26","44","18","Linen bonnets are on their head, and linen trousers are on their loins, they are not restrained with sweat."
"26044019","26","44","19","And in their going forth unto the outer court -- unto the outer court unto the people -- they strip off their garments, in which they are ministering, and have placed them in the holy chambers, and have put on other garments; and they do not sanctify the people in their own garments."
"26044020","26","44","20","And their head they do not shave, and the lock they do not send forth; they certainly poll their heads."
"26044021","26","44","21","And no priest doth drink wine in their coming in unto the inner court."
"26044022","26","44","22","And a widow and divorced woman they do not take to them for wives: but -- virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, and the widow who is widow of a priest, do they take."
"26044023","26","44","23","`And My people they direct between holy and common, and between unclean and clean they cause them to discern."
"26044024","26","44","24","And concerning controversy, they stand up for judgment; with My judgments they judge it; and My law and My statutes in all My appointed places they keep; and My sabbaths they sanctify."
"26044025","26","44","25","And unto any dead man they come not for uncleanness, but for father, and for mother, and for son, and for daughter, for brother, for sister who hath not been to a man, they defile themselves."
"26044026","26","44","26","`And after his cleansing, seven days they number to him."
"26044027","26","44","27","And in the day of his coming in unto the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he bringeth near his sin-offering -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah."
"26044028","26","44","28","And it hath been to them for an inheritance; I `am' their inheritance: and a possession ye do not give to them in Israel; I `am' their possession."
"26044029","26","44","29","The present, and the sin-offering, and the guilt-offering, they do eat, and every devoted thing in Israel is theirs."
"26044030","26","44","30","And the first of all the first-fruits of all, and every heave-offering of all, of all your heave-offerings, are the priests': and the first of your dough ye give to the priest, to cause a blessing to rest on thy house."
"26044031","26","44","31","Any carcase and torn thing, of the fowl, and of the beasts, the priests do not eat."
"26045001","26","45","1","And in your causing the land to fall in inheritance, ye lift up a heave-offering to Jehovah, a holy `portion' of the land: the length -- five and twenty thousand `is' the length, and the breadth ten thousand; it `is' holy in all its border round about."
"26045002","26","45","2","There is of this for the sanctuary five hundred by five hundred, square, round about; and fifty cubits of suburb `is' to it round about."
"26045003","26","45","3","And by this measure thou dost measure: the length `is' five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand: and in it is the sanctuary, the holy of holies."
"26045004","26","45","4","The holy `portion' of the land it `is'; for priests, ministrants of the sanctuary, it is, who are drawing near to serve Jehovah; and it hath been to them a place for houses, and a holy place for a sanctuary."
"26045005","26","45","5","`And of the five and twenty thousand of length, and of the ten thousand of breadth, there is to the Levites, ministrants of the house, for them -- for a possession -- twenty chambers."
"26045006","26","45","6","`And of the possession of the city ye give five thousand of breadth, and of length five and twenty thousand, over-against the heave-offering of the holy `portion': to all the house of Israel it is."
"26045007","26","45","7","As to the prince, on this side, and on that side, of the heave-offering of the holy place, and of the possession of the city, at the front of the heave-offering of the holy place, and at the front of the possession of the city, from the west corner westward, and from the east corner eastward -- and the length `is' over-against one of the portions from the west border unto the east border --"
"26045008","26","45","8","of the land there is to him for a possession in Israel, and My princes do not oppress any more My people, and the land they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes."
"26045009","26","45","9","`Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Enough to you -- princes of Israel; violence and spoil turn aside, and judgment and righteousness do; lift up your exactions from off My people -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah."
"26045010","26","45","10","Just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath -- ye have."
"26045011","26","45","11","The ephah and the bath is of one measure, for the bath to bear a tenth of the homer, and the ephah a tenth of the homer: according to the homer is its measurement."
"26045012","26","45","12","And, the shekel `is' twenty gerah: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels -- is your maneh."
"26045013","26","45","13","`This `is' the heave-offering that ye lift up; a sixth part of the ephah of a homer of wheat, also ye have given a sixth part of the ephah of a homer of barley,"
"26045014","26","45","14","and the portion of oil, the bath of oil, a tenth part of the bath out of the cor, a homer of ten baths -- for ten baths `are' a homer;"
"26045015","26","45","15","and one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the watered country of Israel, for a present, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement by them -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah."
"26045016","26","45","16","All the people of the land are at this heave-offering for the prince in Israel."
"26045017","26","45","17","And on the prince are the burnt-offerings, and the present, and the libation, in feasts, and in new moons, and in sabbaths, in all appointed times of the house of Israel: he doth make the sin-offering, and the present, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel."
"26045018","26","45","18","`Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the first `month', in the first of the month, thou dost take a bullock, a son of the herd, a perfect one, and hast cleansed the sanctuary:"
"26045019","26","45","19","and the priest hath taken of the blood of the sin offering, and hath put on the door-post of the house, and on the four corners of the border of the altar, and on the post of the gate of the inner court."
"26045020","26","45","20","And so thou dost do on the seventh of the month, because of each erring one, and because of the simple one -- and ye have purified the house."
"26045021","26","45","21","`In the first `month', in the fourteenth day of the month, ye have the passover, a feast of seven days, unleavened food is eaten."
"26045022","26","45","22","And the prince hath prepared on that day, for himself, and for all the people of the land, a bullock, a sin-offering."
"26045023","26","45","23","And the seven days of the feast he prepareth a burnt-offering to Jehovah, seven bullocks, and seven rams, perfect ones, daily seven days, and a sin-offering, a kid of the goats, daily."
"26045024","26","45","24","And a present of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, he doth prepare, and of oil a hin for an ephah."
"26045025","26","45","25","In the seventh `month', in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, he doth according to these things seven days; as the sin-offering so the burnt-offering, and as the present so also the oil."
"26046001","26","46","1","`Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court that is looking eastward is shut the six days of work, and on the day of rest it is opened, and in the day of the new moon it is opened;"
"26046002","26","46","2","and come in hath the prince the way of the porch of the gate at the outside, and he hath stood by the post of the gate, and the priests have made his burnt-offering, and his peace-offerings, and he hath bowed himself by the opening of the gate, and hath gone forth, and the gate is not shut till the evening."
"26046003","26","46","3","And bowed themselves have the people of the land at the opening of that gate, on sabbaths, and on new moons, before Jehovah."
"26046004","26","46","4","`And the burnt-offering that the prince bringeth near to Jehovah on the day of rest `is' six lambs, perfect ones, and a ram, a perfect one."
"26046005","26","46","5","And the present `is' an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs a present, the gift of his hand, and of oil a hin for an ephah."
"26046006","26","46","6","And on the day of the new moon a bullock, a son of the herd, a perfect one, and six lambs and a ram, they are perfect."
"26046007","26","46","7","And with an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, he prepareth a present, and for the lambs as his hand attaineth, and of oil a hin for an ephah."
"26046008","26","46","8","`And in the coming in of the prince, the way of the porch of the gate he cometh in, and by its way he goeth out."
"26046009","26","46","9","And in the coming in of the people of the land before Jehovah at appointed times, he who hath come in the way of the north gate to bow himself, goeth out the way of the south gate, and he who hath come in the way of the south gate, goeth out by the way of the north gate: he doth not turn back the way of the gate by which he came in, but over-against it he goeth out."
"26046010","26","46","10","And the prince in their midst in their coming in cometh in, and in their going out he goeth out."
"26046011","26","46","11","`And in feasts, and in appointed times, the present is an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for lambs the gift of his hand, and of oil a hin for an ephah."
"26046012","26","46","12","And when the prince maketh a free-will burnt-offering, or free-will peace-offerings, to Jehovah, then he hath opened for himself the gate that is looking eastward, and he hath made his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings as he doth in the day of rest, and he hath gone out, and he hath shut the gate after his going out."
"26046013","26","46","13","`And a lamb, son of a year, a perfect one, thou dost make a burnt-offering daily to Jehovah; morning by morning thou dost make it."
"26046014","26","46","14","And a present thou dost make for it morning by morning, a sixth part of the ephah, and of oil a third part of the hin, to temper with the fine flour, a present to Jehovah, by a statute age-during -- continually;"

"26046018","26","46","18","And the prince doth not take of the inheritance of the people to oppress them, out of their possession, out of his own possession he doth cause his sons to inherit, so that My people are not scattered each from his possession.'"
"26046019","26","46","19","And he bringeth me in through the entrance that `is' by the side of the gate, unto the holy chambers, unto the priests, that are looking northward, and lo, there `is' a place in their two sides westward."
"26046020","26","46","20","And he saith unto me, `This `is' the place where the priests do boil the guilt-offering and the sin-offering, where they bake the present, so as not to bring `it' out unto the outer court, to sanctify the people.'"
"26046021","26","46","21","And he bringeth me out unto the outer court, and causeth me to pass over unto the four corners of the court, and lo, a court in a corner of the court, a court in a corner of the corner."
"26046022","26","46","22","In the four corners of the court `are' perfume courts, forty long, and thirty broad, one measure `is' to the four corners."

"26046024","26","46","24","And he saith unto me, `These `are' the houses of those boiling where the ministrants of the house boil the sacrifice of the people.'"
"26047001","26","47","1","And he causeth me to turn back unto the opening of the house; and lo, water is coming forth from under the threshold of the house eastward, for the front of the house `is' eastward, and the water is coming down from beneath, from the right side of the house, from the south of the altar."
"26047002","26","47","2","And he causeth me to go out the way of the gate northward, and causeth me to turn round the way without, unto the gate that `is' without, the way that is looking eastward, and lo, water is coming forth from the right side."
"26047003","26","47","3","In the going out of the man eastward, and a line in his hand, then he measureth a thousand by the cubit, and he causeth me to pass over into water -- water to the ankles."
"26047004","26","47","4","And he measureth a thousand, and causeth me to pass over into water -- water to the knees. And he measureth a thousand, and causeth me to pass over -- water to the loins."
"26047005","26","47","5","And he measureth a thousand -- a stream that I am not able to pass over; for risen have the waters -- waters to swim in -- a stream that is not passed over."
"26047006","26","47","6","And he saith unto me, `Hast thou seen, son of man?' and he leadeth me, and bringeth me back unto the edge of the stream."
"26047007","26","47","7","In my turning back, then, lo, at the edge of the stream `are' very many trees, on this side and on that side."
"26047008","26","47","8","And he saith unto me, `These waters are going forth unto the east circuit, and have gone down unto the desert, and have entered the sea; unto the sea they are brought forth, and the waters have been healed."
"26047009","26","47","9","And it hath come to pass, every living creature that teemeth, whithersoever the streams come, doth live: and there hath been great abundance of fish, for these waters have come thither, and they are healed; and every thing whither the stream cometh hath lived."
"26047010","26","47","10","And it hath come to pass, fishers do stand by it, from En-Gedi even unto En-Eglaim; a spreading place of nets they are; according to their own kind is their fish, as the fish of the great sea, very many."
