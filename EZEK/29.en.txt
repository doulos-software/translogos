In the tenth year
`Son of man
Speak
And I have put hooks in thy jaws
And I have left thee in the wilderness
And known have all inhabitants of Egypt That I `am' Jehovah
In their taking hold of thee by thy hand
Therefore
And the land of Egypt hath been for a desolation and a waste
Therefore
Not pass over into it doth a foot of man
And I have made the land of Egypt a desolation
But thus said the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years I gather the Egyptians Out of the peoples whither they have been scattered
And I have turned back `to' the captivity of Egypt
Of the kingdoms it is lowest
And it is no more to the house of Israel for a confidence
And it cometh to pass
`Son of man
Therefore
His wage for which he laboured I have given to him
In that day I cause to shoot up a horn to the house of Israel
