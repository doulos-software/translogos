And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
For near `is' a day
And come in hath a sword to Egypt
Cush
Thus said Jehovah: And -- fallen have supporters of Egypt
And they have been desolated in the midst of desolate lands
And they have known that I `am' Jehovah
In that day go forth do messengers from before Me in ships
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I have caused the multitude of Egypt to cease
He and his people with him -- the terrible of nations
And I have made floods a dry place
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And -- I have destroyed idols
And I have made Pathros desolate
And I have poured out My fury on Sin
And I have given fire against Egypt
The youths of Aven and Pi-Beseth by sword do fall
And in Tehaphnehes hath the day been dark
And I have done judgments in Egypt
And it cometh to pass
The arm of Pharaoh
Therefore
And scattered the Egyptians among nations
And strengthened the arms of the king of Babylon
And I have strengthened the arms of the king of Babylon
And I have scattered the Egyptians among nations
