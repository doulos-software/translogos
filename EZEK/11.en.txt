And lift me up doth a spirit
And He saith unto me
who are saying
Therefore prophesy concerning them
And fall upon me doth the Spirit of Jehovah
Ye multiplied your wounded in this city
Therefore
A sword ye have feared
And I have brought you out of its midst
By the sword ye do fall
It is not to you for a pot
And ye have known that I `am' Jehovah
And it cometh to pass
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
it `is' ours
Therefore say: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And I have assembled you from the peoples
And they have gone in thither. And turned aside all its detestable things
And I have given to them one heart
So that in My statutes they walk
As to those whose heart is going unto the heart Of their detestable and their abominable things
And the cherubs lift up their wings
And the honour of Jehovah goeth up from off the midst of the city
And a spirit hath lifted me up
and I speak unto the Removed all the matters of Jehovah that He hath shewed me."
