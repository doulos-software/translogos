And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
and thou hast said to it: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo
Thy cities a waste I make
Because of thy having an enmity age-during
Therefore
And I have given mount Seir for a desolation and an astonishment
And filled his mountains with his wounded
Desolations age-during I make thee
Because of thy saying: The two nations and the two lands are mine
Therefore
And thou hast known that I -- Jehovah
And ye magnify yourselves against Me with your mouth
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: According to the rejoicing of the whole land
According to thy joy at the inheritance of the house of Israel because of desolation
