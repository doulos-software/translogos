And these `are' the names of the tribes: From the north end unto the side of the way of Hethlon
and by the border of Dan
and by the border of Asher
and by the border of Naphtali
and by the border of Manasseh
and by the border of Ephraim
and by the border of Reuben
and by the border of Judah
The heave-offering that ye lift up to Jehovah `is' five and twenty thousand long
And of these is the holy heave-offering for the priests
For the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok
even the heave-offering hath been to them
`And `to' the Levites over-against the border of the priests `are' five and twenty thousand `in' length
And they do not sell of it
And the five thousand that is left in the breadth
And these `are' its measures: the north side five hundred
And the suburb to the city hath been northward
`And the residue in length over-against the heave-offering of the holy `portion is' ten thousand eastward
even `to' him who is serving the city
All the heave-offering `is' five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand
`And the residue `is' for the prince
And from the possession of the Levites
`As to the rest of the tribes
and by the border of Benjamin
and by the border of Simeon
and by the border of Issachar
and by the border of Zebulun
and by the border of Gad
This `is' the land that ye separate by inheritance to the tribes of Israel
`And these `are' the outgoings of the city on the north side
And the gates of the city `are' according to the names of the tribes of Israel; three gates northward: the gate of Reuben one
And on the east side five hundred
And the south side five hundred
The west side five hundred
Round about `is' eighteen thousand
