And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
And thou hast said: Mountains of Israel
And desolated have been your altars
And put the carcases of the sons of Israel before their idols
In all your dwellings the cities are laid waste
And fallen hath the wounded in your midst
And I have caused `some' to remain
And remembered Me have your escaped among nations
And they have known that I `am' Jehovah
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: `Smite with thy palm
The far-off by pestilence dieth
And ye have known that I `am' Jehovah
And I have stretched out my hand against them
