And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`And thou
and thou hast said: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The city is shedding blood in its midst
By thy blood that thou hast shed thou hast been guilty
The near and the far-off from thee scoff at thee
Lo
Father and mother made light of in thee
My holy things thou hast despised
Men of slander have been in thee to shed blood
The nakedness of a father hath one uncovered in thee
And each with the wife of his neighbour hath done abomination
A bribe they have taken in thee to shed blood
And lo
Doth thy heart stand -- are thy hands strong
And I have scattered thee among nations
And thou hast been polluted in thyself Before the eyes of nations
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
The house of Israel hath been to Me for dross
Therefore
A gathering of silver
And I have heaped you up
As the melting of silver in the midst of a furnace
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
A conspiracy of its prophets `is' in its midst
Its priests have wronged My law
Its princes in its midst `are' as wolves
And its prophets have daubed for them with chalk
The people of the land have used oppression
And I seek of them a man making a fence
And I pour out on them mine indignation
