It `is' the appearance of the likeness of the honour of Jehovah
And there doth come into me a spirit
And He saith unto Me
And the sons `are' brazen-faced and hard-hearted to whom I am sending thee
and they -- whether they hear
`And thou
And thou hast spoken My words unto them
`And thou
And I look
and He spreadeth it before me
