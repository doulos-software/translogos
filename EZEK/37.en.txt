There hath been upon me a hand of Jehovah
and He causeth me to pass over by them
And He saith unto me
And He saith unto me
Thus said the Lord Jehovah to these bones: Lo
and I have given on you sinews
And I have prophesied as I have been commanded
And I beheld
And He saith unto me: `Prophesy unto the Spirit
And I have prophesied as He commanded me
And He saith unto me
Therefore
And ye have known that I `am' Jehovah
And I have given My Spirit in you
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`And thou
and bring them near one unto another
`And when sons of thy people speak unto thee
Speak unto them
And the sticks on which thou writest have been in thy hand before thine eyes
and speak thou unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo
And I have made them become one nation in the land
Nor are they defiled any more with their idols
And My servant David `is' king over them
And they have dwelt on the land that I gave to My servant
And I have made to them a covenant of peace
And My tabernacle hath been over them
And known have the nations that I Jehovah am sanctifying Israel
