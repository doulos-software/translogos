And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`And thou
O dweller on the entrances of the sea
In the heart of the seas `are' thy borders
Of firs of Senir they have built to thee all thy double-boarded ships
Of oaks of Bashan they made thine oars
Of fine linen with embroidery from Egypt hath been thy sail
Inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad have been rowers to thee
Elders of Gebal and its wise men have been in thee
Persian and Lud and Phut Have been in thy forces -- thy men of war. Shield and helmet they hung up in thee
The sons of Arvad
Tarshish `is' thy merchant
Javan
They of the house of Togarmah
Sons of Dedan `are' thy merchants
Aram `is' thy merchant
Judah and the land of Israel -- they `are' thy merchants
Damascus `is' thy merchant
Vedan and Javan go about with thy remnants
Dedan `is' thy merchant
Arabia
Merchants of Sheba and Raamah -- they `are' thy merchants
Haran
They `are' thy merchants for perfect things
Ships of Tarshish `are' thy double walls of thy merchandise
Into great waters have they brought thee
Thy wealth and thy remnants
At the voice of the cry of thy pilots shake do the suburbs."
And come down from their ships have all handling an oar
And have sounded for thee with their voice
And they have made for thee baldness
And lifted up for thee have their sons a lamentation
With the outgoing of thy remnants from the seas
The time of `thy' being broken by the seas in the depths of the waters
All inhabitants of the isles have been astonished at thee
Merchants among the peoples have shrieked for thee
