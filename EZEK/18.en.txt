`And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`What -- to you
I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah
Lo
And a man
On the mountains he hath not eaten
A man -- he doth not oppress
In usury he doth not give
In My statutes he doth walk
And -- he hath begotten a son
And he all those hath not done
The afflicted and needy he hath oppressed
In usury he hath given
And -- lo
On the mountains he hath not eaten
A man -- he hath not oppressed
From the afflicted he hath turned back his hand
His father -- because he used oppression
And ye have said
The soul that doth sin -- it doth die. A son doth not bear of the iniquity of the father
And the wicked -- when he turneth back From all his sins that he hath done
All his transgressions that he hath done Are not remembered to him
Do I at all desire the death of the wicked? An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah
And in the turning back of the righteous from his righteousness
And ye have said
In the turning back of the righteous from his righteousness
And in the turning back of the wicked From his wickedness that he hath done
And he seeth and turneth back
And the house of Israel have said
Therefore
Cast from off you all your transgressions
For I have no pleasure in the death of the dying
