And thou
and thou hast said: What `is' thy mother? -- a lioness
And she bringeth up one of her whelps
And hear of it do nations
And she seeth
And it goeth up and down in the midst of lions
And it knoweth his forsaken habitations
And set against it do nations Round about from the provinces. And they spread out for it their net
And they put it in prison -- in chains
Thy mother `is' as a vine in thy blood by waters planted
And it hath strong rods for sceptres of rulers
And it is plucked up in fury
And now -- it is planted in a wilderness
And go forth doth fire from a rod of its boughs
