And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
Thus said the Lord Jehovah to Jerusalem: Thy birth and thy nativity `Are' of the land of the Canaanite
As to thy nativity
No eye hath had pity on thee
And I do pass over by thee
A myriad -- as the shoot of the field I have made thee
And I pass over by thee
And I do wash thee with water
And I clothe thee with embroidery
And I adorn thee with adornments
And I give a ring for thy nose
And thou dost put on gold and silver
And go forth doth thy name among nations
And thou dost trust in thy beauty
And thou dost take of thy garments
And thou dost take thy beauteous vessels Of My gold and My silver that I gave to thee
And dost take the garments of thy embroidery
And My bread
And thou dost take thy sons and thy daughters Whom thou hast born to Me
That thou dost slaughter My sons
And with all thine abominations and thy whoredoms
And it cometh to pass
That thou dost build to thee an arch
At every head of the way thou hast built thy high place
And dost go a-whoring unto sons of Egypt
And lo
And thou goest a-whoring unto sons of Asshur
And thou dost multiply thy whoredoms On the land of Canaan -- toward Chaldea
How weak `is' thy heart
In thy building thine arch at the head of every way
The wife who committeth adultery -- Under her husband -- doth receive strangers."
To all whores they give a gift
And the contrary is in thee from women in thy whoredoms
Therefore
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of thy brass being poured forth
Therefore
And I have judged thee -- judgments of adultresses
And I have given thee into their hand
And have caused an assembly to come up against thee
And burnt thy houses with fire
And I have caused My fury against thee to rest
Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth
Lo
Thy mother's daughter thou `art'
And thine elder sister `is' Samaria
And -- in their ways thou hast not walked
I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah
Lo
And they are haughty and do abomination before Me
As to Samaria
Thou also -- bear thy shame
And I have turned back `to' their captivity
So that thou dost bear thy shame
And thy sisters
And thy sister Sodom hath not been for a report in thy mouth
Before thy wickedness is revealed
Thy devices and thine abominations
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: I have dealt with thee as thou hast done
And I -- I have remembered My covenant with thee
And thou hast remembered thy ways
And I -- I have established My covenant with thee
So that thou dost remember
