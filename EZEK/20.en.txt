And it cometh to pass
and there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
Dost thou judge them? Dost thou judge
and thou hast said unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the day of My fixing on Israel
In that day I did lift up My hand to them
And I say unto them
And -- they rebel against Me
And I do `it' for My name's sake
And I bring them out of the land of Egypt
And I give to them My statutes
And also My sabbaths I have given to them
And -- rebel against me do the house of Israel in the wilderness
And I do `it' for My name's sake
And also
Because against My judgments they did kick
And Mine eye hath pity on them -- against destroying them
And I say to their sons in the wilderness: In the statutes of your fathers ye walk not
I `am' Jehovah your God
And My sabbaths sanctify
And -- the sons rebel against Me
And I have turned back My hand
I also
Because My judgments they have not done
And I also
And I defile them by their own gifts
Therefore
And I bring them in unto the land
And I say unto them: What `is' the high place whither ye are going in? And its name is called `high place' to this day."
Therefore
And in the offering of your gifts
And that which is going up on your mind
I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah
And I have brought you forth from the peoples
And I have brought you in unto the wilderness of the peoples
As I was judged with your fathers
And I have caused you to pass under the rod
And cleared out from you the rebels
And ye
For
With sweet fragrance I do accept you
And ye have known that I `am' Jehovah
And ye have remembered there your ways
And ye have known that I `am' Jehovah
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
Son of man
and thou hast said to the forest of the south: Hear a word of Jehovah: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo
And seen have all flesh
And I say
