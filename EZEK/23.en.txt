And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
Two women were daughters of one mother
And they go a-whoring in Egypt
And their names `are' Aholah the elder
And go a-whoring doth Aholah under Me
Clothed with blue -- governors and prefects
And she giveth her whoredoms on them
And her whoredoms out of Egypt she hath not forsaken
Therefore I have given her into the hand of her lovers
They have uncovered her nakedness
And see doth her sister Aholibah
On sons of Asshur she hath doted
And I see that she hath been defiled
And she doth add unto her whoredoms
Girded with a girdle on their loins
And she doteth on them at the sight of her eyes
And come in unto her do sons of Babylon
And she revealeth her whoredoms
And she multiplieth her whoredoms
And she doteth on their paramours
Thou lookest after the wickedness of thy youth
Therefore
Sons of Babylon
And they have come in against thee
And I have set My jealousy against thee
And they have stripped thee of thy garments
And I have caused thy wickedness to cease from thee
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo
And they have dealt with thee in hatred
To do these things to thee
In the way of thy sister thou hast walked
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The cup of thy sister thou dost drink
With drunkenness and sorrow thou art filled
And thou hast drunk it
Therefore
And Jehovah saith unto me
For they have committed adultery
Again
And in their slaughtering their sons to their idols They also come in unto My sanctuary in that day to pollute it
And also that they send to men coming from afar
And thou hast sat on a couch of honour
And the voice of a multitude at ease `is' with her
And I say of the worn-out one in adulteries
And they come in unto her
As to righteous men
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Bring up against them an assembly
And they have cast at them the stone of the assembly
And I have caused wickedness to cease from the land
And they have put your wickedness on you
