And it cometh to pass
Because that Tyre hath said of Jerusalem: Aha
Therefore
And they have destroyed the walls of Tyre
A spreading place of nets she is in the midst of the sea
And her daughters who `are' in the field
For
Thy daughters in the field by sword he slayeth
And a battering-ram before him he placeth against thy walls
From the abundance of his horses cover thee doth their dust
With hoofs of his horses he treadeth all thine out-places
And they have spoiled thy wealth
And I have caused the noise of thy songs to cease
And I have given thee up for a clear place of a rock
Thus said the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: Do not -- from the noise of thy fall
And come down from off their thrones have all princes of the sea
And have lifted up for thee a lamentation
Now they tremble
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: In my making thee a city wasted
And I have caused thee to go down
Wastes I do make thee
