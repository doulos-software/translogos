And I look
And He speaketh unto the man clothed with linen
And the cherubs are standing on the right side of the house
and become high doth the honour of Jehovah above the cherub
And a noise of the wings of the cherubs hath been heard unto the outer court
And it cometh to pass
that the `one' cherub putteth forth his hand from between the cherubs unto the fire that `is' between the cherubs
And there appeareth in the cherubs the form of a hand of man under their wings
and I look
As to their appearances
In their going
And all their flesh
To the wheels -- to them is one calling in mine ears
And four faces `are' to each; the face of the one `is' the face of the cherub
And the cherubs are lifted up
And in the going of the cherubs
In their standing they stand
And go forth doth the honour of Jehovah from off the threshold of the house
and the cherubs lift up their wings
It `is' the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar
Four faces `are' to each
As to the likeness of their faces
