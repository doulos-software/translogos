And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
An end
Now `is' the end unto thee
And no pity on thee hath Mine eye
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Evil
An end hath come
Come hath the morning unto thee
Now
And not pity doth Mine eye
Lo
The violence hath risen to a rod of wickedness
Come hath the time
For the seller to the sold thing turneth not
They have blown with a trumpet to prepare the whole
The sword `is' without
And escaped away have their fugitives
All the hands are feeble
And they have girded on sackcloth
Their silver into out-places they cast
As to the beauty of his ornament
And I have given it into the hand of the strangers for a prey
And I have turned My face from them
Make the chain; for the land Hath been full of bloody judgments
And I have brought in the wicked of the nations
Destruction hath come
Mischief on mischief cometh
The king doth become a mourner
