And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
And thou
And thou hast brought forth thy vessels as vessels of removal by day before their eyes
Before their eyes dig for thee through the wall
Before their eyes on the shoulder thou dost bear
And I do so
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
say unto them
Say: I `am' your type; as I have done so it is done to them
As to the prince who `is' in their midst
And I have spread My net for him
`And all who are round about him to help him
And they have known that I `am' Jehovah
and I have left of them
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
and thou hast said unto the people of the land
And the cities that are inhabited are laid waste
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
therefore say unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I have caused this simile to cease
For there is no more any vain vision
For I `am' Jehovah
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
therefore say unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: None of my words are prolonged any more
