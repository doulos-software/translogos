And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
and thou hast said: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Lo
And I have turned thee back
Persia
Gomer and all its bands
Be prepared
After many days thou art appointed
And thou hast gone up -- as wasting thou comest in
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And it hath come to pass in that day
And thou hast said: I go up against a land of unwalled villages
To take a spoil
Sheba
Therefore
And thou hast come in out of thy place
And thou hast come up against My people Israel
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Art thou he of whom I spake in former days
And it hath come to pass
And in My zeal
And rushed from My presence have fishes of the sea
And I have called against him
And I have been judged with him
And I have magnified Myself
