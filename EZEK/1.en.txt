And it cometh to pass
In the fifth of the month -- it is the fifth year of the removal of the king Jehoiachin --"
hath the word of Jehovah certainly been unto Ezekiel son of Buzi the priest
And I look
And out of its midst `is' a likeness of four living creatures
and four faces `are' to each
and their feet `are' straight feet
and hands of man under their wings -- on their four sides
joining one unto another `are' their wings
As to the likeness of their faces
And their faces and their wings are separate from above
And each straight forward they go
As to the likeness of the living creatures
And the living creatures are running
And I see the living creatures
The appearance of the wheels and their works `is' as the colour of beryl
On their four sides
As to their rings
And in the going of the living creatures
Whither the spirit is to go
In their going
And a likeness `is' over the heads of the living creatures of an expanse
And under the expanse their wings `are' straight
And I hear the noise of their wings
And there is a voice from above the expanse
And above the expanse that `is' over their head
And I see as the colour of copper
As the appearance of the bow that is in a cloud in a day of rain
