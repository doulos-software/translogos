And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
The fat ye do eat
The weak ye have not strengthened
And they are scattered from want of a shepherd
Go astray do My flock on all the mountains
Therefore
I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah
Therefore
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo
As a shepherd's searching of his drove
And brought them out from the peoples
With good pasture I do feed them
I feed My flock
The lost I seek
And you
Is it a little thing for you -- the good pasture ye enjoy
And My flock the trodden thing of your feet consumeth
Therefore
Because with side and with shoulder ye thrust away
And I have given safety to My flock
And have raised up over them one shepherd
And I
And I have made for them a covenant of peace
And I have given them
And given hath the tree of the field its fruit
And they are no more a prey to nations
And I have raised for them a plant for renown
And they have known that I
And ye
