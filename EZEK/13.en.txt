And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo unto the prophets who are foolish
As foxes in the wastes
Ye have not gone up into breaches
They have seen vanity
A vain vision have ye not seen
Therefore
And My hand hath been on the prophets
Because
Say to those daubing with chalk -- It falleth
And lo
Therefore
And I have broken down the wall that ye daubed with chalk
And I have completed My wrath on the wall
The prophets of Israel who are prophesying concerning Jerusalem
And thou
And thou hast said: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo to those sowing pillows for all joints of the arm
Yea
Therefore
And I have torn your kerchiefs
Because of paining the heart of the righteous with falsehood
Therefore
