And he causeth me to turn back unto the opening of the house; and lo
And he causeth me to go out the way of the gate northward
In the going out of the man eastward
And he measureth a thousand
And he measureth a thousand -- a stream that I am not able to pass over; for risen have the waters -- waters to swim in -- a stream that is not passed over."
And he saith unto me
In my turning back
And he saith unto me
And it hath come to pass
And it hath come to pass
Its miry and its marshy places -- they are not healed; to salt they have been given up."
And by the stream there cometh up on its edge
`Thus said the Lord Jehovah: This `is' the border whereby ye inherit the land
And ye have inherited it
`And this `is' the border of the land at the north quarter; from the great sea
Hamath
And the border from the sea hath been Hazar-Enan
`And the east quarter `is' from between Havran
`And the south quarter southward `is' from Tamar unto the waters of Meriboth-Kadesh
`And the west quarter `is' the great sea
`And ye have divided this land to you
and it hath come to pass
And it hath come to pass
