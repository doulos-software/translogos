And it cometh to pass
`Son of man
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And -- I have spread out for thee My net
And I have left thee in the land
And I have put thy flesh on the mountains
And watered the land with thy flowing
And in quenching thee I have covered the heavens
All luminaries of light in the heavens
And I have vexed the heart of many peoples
And I have made many peoples astonished at thee
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: A sword of the king of Babylon entereth thee
By swords of the mighty I cause thy multitude to fall
And I have destroyed all her beasts
Then do I cause their waters to sink
In My making the land of Egypt a desolation
A lamentation it `is'
And it cometh to pass
`Son of man
Than whom hast thou been more pleasant? Go down
In the midst of the pierced of the sword they fall
Speak to him do the gods of the mighty out of the midst of sheol
There `is' Asshur
Whose graves are appointed in the sides of the pit
There `is' Elam
In the midst of the wounded they have appointed a bed for her with all her multitude
There `is' Meshech
And they lie not with the mighty
And thou
There `is' Edom
There `are' princes of the north
Then doth Pharaoh see
For I have given his terror in the land of the living
