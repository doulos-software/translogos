In the twenty and fifth year of our removal
in visions of God He hath brought me in unto the land of Israel
And He bringeth me in thither
and the man speaketh unto me: `Son of man
And lo
And he cometh in unto the gate whose front `is' eastward
and the little chamber one reed long and one reed broad
And he measureth the porch of the gate from within one reed
and he measureth the porch of the gate eight cubits
and the little chambers of the gate eastward
And he measureth the breadth of the opening of the gate ten cubits
and a border before the little chambers
And he measureth the gate from the roof of the `one' little chamber to the roof of another; the breadth twenty and five cubits
And he maketh the posts of sixty cubits
and by the front of the gate of the entrance
and narrow windows `are' unto the little chambers
And he bringeth me in unto the outer court
and the pavement unto the side of the gates over-against the length of the gates `is' the lower pavement;"
and he measureth the breadth from before the lower gate
As to the gate of the outer court whose front `is' northward
and its little chambers
and its windows
And the gate of the inner court `is' over-against the gate at the north and at the east; and he measureth from gate unto gate
And he causeth me to go southward
and windows `are' to it and to its arches all round about
and seven steps `are' its ascent
and the gate of the inner court `is' southward
And he bringeth me in unto the inner court by the south gate
and its little chambers
As to the arches all round about
and its arches `are' unto the outer court
And he bringeth me in unto the inner court eastward
and its little chambers
and its arches `are' toward the outer court
And he bringeth me in unto the north gate
its little chambers
and its posts `are' to the outer court
And the chamber and its opening `is' by the posts of the gates
And in the porch of the gate `are' two tables on this side
and at the side without
four tables `are' on this side
And the four tables for burnt-offering `are' of hewn stone: the length one cubit and a half
And the boundaries `are' one handbreadth
And on the outside of the inner gate `are' chambers of the singers
And he speaketh unto me: `This chamber
and the chamber
And he measureth the court: the length a hundred cubits
And he bringeth me in unto the porch of the house
the length of the porch twenty cubits
