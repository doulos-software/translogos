And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
And he hath seen the sword coming against the land
And the hearer hath heard the voice of the trumpet
The voice of the trumpet he heard
And the watchman
And thou
In My saying to the wicked
And thou
And thou
Say unto them
And thou
In My saying of the righteous: He surely liveth
And in My saying to the wicked: Thou surely diest
(The pledge the wicked restoreth
None of his sin that he hath sinned is remembered to him
And the sons of thy people have said: The way of the Lord is not pondered
In the turning back of the righteous from his righteousness
And in the turning back of the wicked from his wickedness
And ye have said: The way of the Lord is not pondered
And it cometh to pass
And the hand of Jehovah hath been unto me in the evening
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
Therefore say unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: With the blood ye do eat
Ye have stood on your sword
Thus dost thou say unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I live -- do not they who `are' in the wastes by the sword fall? And they who `are' on the face of the field
And I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment
And they have known that I `am' Jehovah
And thou
And they come in unto thee as the coming in of a people
And lo
And in its coming in -- lo
