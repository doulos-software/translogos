And come in unto me do certain of the elders of Israel
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
`Therefore
in order to catch the house of Israel by their heart
`Therefore say unto the house of Israel: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Turn ye back
for every one of the house of Israel
and I have set My face against that man
`And the prophet
And they have borne their iniquity: as the iniquity of the inquirer
so that the house of Israel do not wander any more from after Me
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
and these three men have been in its midst
`If an evil beast I cause to pass through the land
these three men in its midst: I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah -- neither sons nor daughters do they deliver; they alone are delivered
`Or -- a sword I bring in against that land
and these three men in its midst: I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah -- they deliver not sons and daughters
`Or -- pestilence I send unto that land
and Noah
`For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Although My four sore judgments -- sword
yet
And they have comforted you
