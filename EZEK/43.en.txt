And he causeth me to go to the gate
And lo
And according to the appearance `is' the appearance that I saw
And the honour of Jehovah hath come in unto the house
And take me up doth the Spirit
And I hear one speaking unto me from the house
and He saith unto me: `Son of man
In their putting their threshold with My threshold
Now do they put far off their whoredom
Thou
And since they have been ashamed of all that they have done
This `is' a law of the house: on the top of the mountain
`And these `are' measures of the altar by cubits: The cubit `is' a cubit and a handbreadth
And from the centre of the ground unto the lower border `is' two cubits
`And the altar `is' four cubits
And the altar `is' twelve long by twelve broad
And the border `is' fourteen long by fourteen broad
And He saith unto me
And thou hast given unto the priests
And thou hast taken of its blood
And thou hast taken the bullock of the sin-offering
And on the second day thou dost bring near a kid of the goats
In thy finishing cleansing
And thou hast brought them near before Jehovah
Seven days thou dost prepare a goat for a sin-offering daily
Seven days they purify the altar
And the days are completed
