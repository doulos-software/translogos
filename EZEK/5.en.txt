`And thou
A third part with fire thou dost burn in the midst of the city
And thou hast taken thence a few in number -- and hast bound them in thy skirts;"
and of them thou dost take again
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: this `is' Jerusalem
And she changeth My judgments into wickedness more than the nations
Therefore
Therefore
And I have done in thee that which I have not done
Therefore fathers do eat sons in thy midst
Therefore
Thy third part -- by pestilence they die
And completed hath been Mine anger
And I give thee for a waste
And it hath been a reproach and a reviling
In My sending the evil arrows of famine among them
And I have sent on you famine and evil beasts
