`Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court that is looking eastward is shut the six days of work
and come in hath the prince the way of the porch of the gate at the outside
And bowed themselves have the people of the land at the opening of that gate
`And the burnt-offering that the prince bringeth near to Jehovah on the day of rest `is' six lambs
And the present `is' an ephah for a ram
And on the day of the new moon a bullock
And with an ephah for a bullock
`And in the coming in of the prince
And in the coming in of the people of the land before Jehovah at appointed times
And the prince in their midst in their coming in cometh in
`And in feasts
And when the prince maketh a free-will burnt-offering
`And a lamb
And a present thou dost make for it morning by morning
and prepare ye the lamb
`Thus said the Lord Jehovah: When the prince giveth a gift to any of his sons
And when he giveth a gift out of his inheritance to one of his servants
And the prince doth not take of the inheritance of the people to oppress them
And he bringeth me in through the entrance that `is' by the side of the gate
And he saith unto me
And he bringeth me out unto the outer court
In the four corners of the court `are' perfume courts
And a row `is' round about in them
And he saith unto me
