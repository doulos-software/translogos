And in your causing the land to fall in inheritance
There is of this for the sanctuary five hundred by five hundred
And by this measure thou dost measure: the length `is' five and twenty thousand
The holy `portion' of the land it `is'; for priests
`And of the five and twenty thousand of length
`And of the possession of the city ye give five thousand of breadth
As to the prince
of the land there is to him for a possession in Israel
`Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Enough to you -- princes of Israel; violence and spoil turn aside
Just balances
The ephah and the bath is of one measure
And
`This `is' the heave-offering that ye lift up; a sixth part of the ephah of a homer of wheat
and the portion of oil
and one lamb out of the flock
All the people of the land are at this heave-offering for the prince in Israel."
And on the prince are the burnt-offerings
`Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the first `month'
and the priest hath taken of the blood of the sin offering
And so thou dost do on the seventh of the month
`In the first `month'
And the prince hath prepared on that day
And the seven days of the feast he prepareth a burnt-offering to Jehovah
And a present of an ephah for a bullock
In the seventh `month'
