And thou
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy said against you
therefore
Therefore
Therefore
Therefore
Therefore
And ye
For
And I have multiplied on you men
And I have multiplied on you man and beast
And I have caused man to walk over you
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because they are saying to you: A devourer of men `art' thou
Therefore
And I proclaim not unto thee any more the shame of the nations
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
And I do pour out My fury upon them For the blood that they shed on the land
And I scatter them among nations
And one goeth in unto the nations whither they have gone
And I have pity on My holy name
Therefore
And I have sanctified My great name
And I have taken you out of the nations
And I have sprinkled over you clean water
And I have given to you a new heart
And My Spirit I give in your midst
And ye have dwelt in the land that I have given to your fathers
And I have saved you from all your uncleannesses
And I have multiplied the fruit of the tree
And ye have remembered your ways that `are' evil
Not for your sake am I working
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the day of My cleansing you from all your iniquities
And the desolate land is tilled
And they have said: This land
And known have the nations who are left round about you
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Yet this I am required
As a flock of holy ones
