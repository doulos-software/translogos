`And thou
and hast placed against it a siege
And thou
`And thou
And I -- I have laid on thee the years of their iniquity
And thou hast completed these
`And unto the siege of Jerusalem thou dost prepare thy face
And lo
`And thou
And thy food that thou dost eat `is' by weight
`And water by measure thou dost drink
A barley-cake thou dost eat it
And Jehovah saith
And I say
And He saith unto me
And He saith unto me
so that they lack bread and water
