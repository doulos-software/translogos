And it cometh to pass
and I look
And He putteth forth a form of a hand
and lo
And He saith unto me
And He saith unto me
And He bringeth me in unto an opening of the court
and He saith unto me
And He saith to me
And I go in
and seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel -- and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan standing in their midst -- are standing before them
And He saith unto me
And He saith unto me
And He bringeth me in unto the opening of the gate of the house of Jehovah that `is' at the north
And He saith unto me
And He bringeth me in unto the inner court of the house of Jehovah
And He saith unto me
And I also deal in fury
