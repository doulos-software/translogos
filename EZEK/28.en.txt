And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
Lo
By thy wisdom and by thine understanding Thou hast made for thee wealth
By the abundance of thy wisdom
Therefore
Therefore
To destruction they bring thee down
Dost thou really say
The deaths of the uncircumcised thou diest
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
In Eden
Thou `art' an anointed cherub who is covering
Perfect `art' thou in thy ways
By the abundance of thy merchandise They have filled thy midst with violence
High hath been thy heart
From the abundance of thy iniquity
All knowing thee among the peoples Have been astonished at thee
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
and thou hast said: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo
And I have sent into her pestilence
And there is no more to the house of Israel A pricking brier
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In My gathering the house of Israel
And they have dwelt on it confidently
