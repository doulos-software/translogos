And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
and thou hast said unto the ground of Israel: Thus said Jehovah: Lo
Because that I have cut off from thee righteous and wicked
And known have all flesh that I
And thou
and it hath come to pass
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
So as to slaughter a slaughter it is sharpened. So as to have brightness it is polished
And he giveth it for polishing
Cry and howl
Because `it is' a trier
And thou
To melt the heart
Take possession of the right
And I also
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`And thou
A way appoint for the coming of the sword
For stood hath the king of Babylon at the head of the way
At his right hath been the divination -- Jerusalem
And it hath been to them as a false divination in their eyes
Therefore
And thou
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Turn aside the mitre
An overturn
And thou
In the seeing for thee of a vain thing
Turn `it' back unto its scabbard
And I have poured on thee Mine indignation
To the fire thou art for fuel
