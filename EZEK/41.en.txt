And he bringeth me in unto the temple
And the breadth of the opening `is' ten cubits; and the sides of the opening `are' five cubits on this side
And he hath gone inward
And he measureth its length twenty cubits
And he measureth the wall of the house six cubits
And the side-chambers `are' side-chamber by side-chamber
And a broad place and a turning place still upwards `are' to the side-chambers
And I have looked at the house
The breadth of the wall that `is' to the side-chamber at the outside `is' five cubits; and that which is left `is' the place of the side-chambers that `are' to the house."
And between the chambers `is' a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house
And the opening of the side-chamber `is' to the place left
As to the building that `is' at the front of the separate place `at' the corner westward
And he hath measured the house
and the breadth of the front of the house
And he hath measured the length of the building unto the front of the separate place that `is' at its hinder part
the thresholds
over above the opening
And it is made `with' cherubs and palm-trees
and the face of man `is' unto the palm-tree on this side
from the earth unto above the opening `are' the cherubs and the palm-trees made
Of the temple the side post `is' square
Of the altar
And two doors `are' to the temple and to the sanctuary;"
and two leaves `are' to the doors
And made on them
And narrow windows and palm-trees `are' on this side
