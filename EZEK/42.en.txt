And he bringeth me forth unto the outer court
At the front of the length `is' a hundred cubits `at' the north opening
Over-against the twenty `cubits' that are to the inner court
And at the front of the chambers `is' a walk of ten cubits in breadth unto the inner part
And the upper chambers `are' short
for they `are' threefold
As to the wall that `is' at the outside
for the length of the chambers that `are' to the outer court `is' fifty cubits
And under these chambers `is' the entrance from the east
In the breadth of the wall of the court eastward
And the way before them `is' as the appearance of the chambers that `are' northward
And according to the openings of the chambers that `are' southward `is' an opening at the head of the way
And he saith unto me
In the priests' going in
And he hath finished the measurements of the inner house
He hath measured the east side with the measuring-reed
He hath measured the north side
The south side he hath measured
He hath turned round unto the west side
At the four sides he hath measured it
