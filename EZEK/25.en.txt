And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Son of man
and thou hast said to the sons of Ammon: Hear ye a word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of thy saying
Therefore
And I have given Rabbah for a habitation of camels
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of thy clapping the hand
Therefore
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of the saying of Moab and Seir: Lo
Therefore
To the sons of the east
And in Moab I do judgments
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of the doings of Edom
Therefore
And I have given My vengeance on Edom
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of the doings of the Philistines in vengeance
Therefore
And done upon them great vengeance with furious reproofs
