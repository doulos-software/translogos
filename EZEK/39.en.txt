And thou
And have turned thee back
And have smitten thy bow out of thy left hand
On mountains of Israel thou fallest
On the face of the field thou fallest
And I have sent a fire against Magog
And My holy name I make known in the midst of My people Israel
Lo
And gone out have the inhabitants of cities of Israel
And they do not take wood out of the field
And it hath come to pass
And the house of Israel have buried them -- in order to cleanse the land -- seven months."
Yea
And men for continual employment they separate
And those passing by have passed through the land
And also the name of the city `is' The multitude; and they have cleansed the land."
And thou
Flesh of the mighty ye do eat
And ye have eaten fat to satiety
And ye have been satisfied at My table with horse and rider
And I have given My honour among nations
And known have the house of Israel that I `am' Jehovah their God
And known have the nations that for their iniquity
According to their uncleanness
Therefore
And they have forgotten their shame
In My bringing them back from the peoples
And they have known that I `am' Jehovah their God
And I hide not any more My face from them
