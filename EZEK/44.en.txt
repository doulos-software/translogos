And he causeth me to turn back the way of the gate of the outer sanctuary that is looking eastward
And Jehovah saith unto me
The prince
And he bringeth me in the way of the north gate unto the front of the house
And Jehovah saith unto me
and hast said unto the rebellious
In your bringing in sons of a stranger
and ye have not kept the charge of My holy things
`Thus said the Lord Jehovah: No son of a stranger
but -- the Levites who have gone far off from me
And they have been in My sanctuary ministrants
Because that they serve them before their idols
And they draw not nigh unto Me to act as My priest
and I made them keepers of the charge of the house
`And the priests
they come in unto My sanctuary
And it hath come to pass
Linen bonnets are on their head
And in their going forth unto the outer court -- unto the outer court unto the people -- they strip off their garments
And their head they do not shave
And no priest doth drink wine in their coming in unto the inner court."
And a widow and divorced woman they do not take to them for wives: but -- virgins of the seed of the house of Israel
`And My people they direct between holy and common
And concerning controversy
And unto any dead man they come not for uncleanness
`And after his cleansing
And in the day of his coming in unto the sanctuary
And it hath been to them for an inheritance; I `am' their inheritance: and a possession ye do not give to them in Israel; I `am' their possession."
The present
And the first of all the first-fruits of all
Any carcase and torn thing
