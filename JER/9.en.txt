Who doth make my head waters
Who doth give me in a wilderness A lodging-place of travellers? And I leave my people
And they bend their tongue
Each of his friend -- beware ye
And each at his friend they mock
thy dwelling `is' in the midst of deceit
Therefore
A slaughtering arrow `is' their tongue
For these things do not I see after them? An affirmation of Jehovah
For the mountains I lift up weeping and wailing
And I make Jerusalem become heaps
Who `is' the wise man? and he understandeth this
And Jehovah saith: Because of their forsaking My law that I set before them
And they walk after the stubbornness of their heart
Therefore
And I have scattered them among nations Which they knew not
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Consider ye
And they hasten
For -- a voice of wailing is heard from Zion: How have we been spoiled! We have been greatly ashamed
But hear
For death hath come up into our windows
Speak thus -- an affirmation of Jehovah
Thus said Jehovah: Let not the wise boast himself in his wisdom
But -- in this let the boaster boast himself
Lo
On Egypt
