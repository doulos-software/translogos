And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah a second time -- and he `is' yet detained in the court of the prison -- saying:"
Thus said Jehovah its maker
Call unto Me
For thus said Jehovah
they are coming in to fight with the Chaldeans
Lo
And I have turned back the captivity of Judah
And cleansed them from all their iniquity
And it hath been to Me for a name of joy
Thus said Jehovah: Again heard in this place of which ye are saying
Is a voice of joy and a voice of gladness
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Again there is in this place -- that is waste
In the cities of the hill-country
Lo
In those days
In those days is Judah saved
For thus said Jehovah: `Not cut off to David is one sitting on the throne of the house of Israel
And to the priests -- the Levites
And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah
`Thus said Jehovah: If ye do break My covenant of the day
Also My covenant is broken with David My servant
As the host of the heavens is not numbered
And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah
`Hast thou not considered what this people have spoken
Thus said Jehovah: If My covenant `is' not daily and nightly
Also the seed of Jacob
