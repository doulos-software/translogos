The word that hath been unto Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who are dwelling in the land of Egypt -- who are dwelling in Migdol
`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts
because of their wickedness that they have done
`And I send unto you all my servants
and they have not hearkened nor inclined their ear
and poured out is My fury
`And
by provoking Me to anger by the works of your hands
`Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers
They have not been humbled unto this day
`Therefore
and I have taken the remnant of Judah
`And I have seen after those dwelling in the land of Egypt
and there is not an escaped and remaining one of the remnant of Judah
And they answer Jeremiah -- all the men who are knowing that their wives are making perfume to other gods
`The word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of Jehovah -- we are not hearkening unto thee;"
for we certainly do everything that hath gone out of our mouth
`And from the time we have ceased to make perfume to the queen of the heavens
and when we are making perfume to the queen of the heavens
And Jeremiah saith unto all the people
`The perfume that ye made in the cities of Judah
And Jehovah is not able any more to accept `you'
`Because that ye have made perfume
And Jeremiah saith unto all the people
Thus spake Jehovah of Hosts
`Therefore
Lo
`And the escaped of the sword turn back out of the land of Egypt to the land of Judah
`And this `is' to you the sign -- an affirmation of Jehovah -- that I am seeing after you in this place
Thus said Jehovah
