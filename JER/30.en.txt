The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah
`Thus spake Jehovah
For
And these `are' the words that Jehovah hath spoken concerning Israel and concerning Judah:"
Surely thus said Jehovah: A voice of trembling we have heard
Ask
Wo! for great `is' that day
And it hath come to pass
And they have served Jehovah their God
And thou
For with thee `am' I
For thus said Jehovah: Incurable is thy breach
There is none judging thy cause to bind up
all loving thee have forgotten thee
What! -- thou criest concerning thy breach! Incurable `is' thy pain
Therefore all consuming thee are consumed
For I increase health to thee
Thus said Jehovah: Lo
And gone forth from them hath thanksgiving
And his sons have been as aforetime
And his honourable one hath been of himself
And ye have been to Me for a people
Lo
The fierceness of the anger of Jehovah Doth not turn back till His doing
