And Pashhur son of Immer the priest -- who also `is' overseer
and Pashhur smiteth Jeremiah the prophet
and it cometh to pass on the morrow
For thus said Jehovah: Lo
And I have given all the strength of this city
And thou
Thou hast persuaded me
Because from the time I speak I cry out
And I said
For I have heard the evil report of many
And Jehovah `is' with me
And
Sing ye to Jehovah
Cursed `is' the day in which I was born
Cursed `is' the man who bore tidings `to' my father
Then hath that man been as the cities
Because he hath not put me to death from the womb
Why `is' this? from the womb I have come out
