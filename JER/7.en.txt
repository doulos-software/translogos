The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah
Stand in the gate of the house of Jehovah
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts
Do not trust for yourselves Unto the words of falsehood
For
Sojourner
Then I have caused you to dwell in this place
Lo
Stealing
And ye have come in and stood before Me
A den of burglars hath this house
But go ye
And now
I also to the house on which My name is called
And I have cast you from before My face
And thou dost not pray for this people
Art thou not seeing what they are doing In cities of Judah
The sons are gathering wood
Me are they provoking to anger? an affirmation of Jehovah
Therefore
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts
For I did not speak with your fathers
But this thing I commanded them
And they have not hearkened
Even from the day when your fathers Went out of the land of Egypt till this day
And they have not hearkened unto Me
And thou hast spoken unto them all these words
And thou hast said unto them: This `is' the nation that hath not hearkened
Cut off thy crown
For the sons of Judah Have done the evil thing in Mine eyes
And have built the high places of Tophet
Therefore
And the carcase of this people hath been for food To a fowl of the heavens
And I have caused to cease from cities of Judah
