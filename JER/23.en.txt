Wo to shepherds destroying
Therefore
And I do gather the remnant of My flock Out of all the lands whither I drove them
And I have raised for them shepherds
Lo
In his days is Judah saved
Therefore
But -- Jehovah liveth
In reference to the prophets: Broken hath been my heart in my midst
For of adulterers hath the land been full
For both prophet and priest have been profane
Therefore is their way to them as slippery places
And in prophets of Samaria I have seen folly
And in prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing
Therefore
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Ye do not hearken unto the words Of the prophets who are prophesying to you
Saying diligently to those despising The word of Jehovah: Peace is for you
For who hath stood in the counsel of Jehovah
Lo
The anger of Jehovah doth not turn back Till His doing
I have not sent the prophets
But -- if they stood in My counsel
A God near `am' I -- an affirmation of Jehovah
Is any one hidden in secret places
I have heard that which the prophets said
Till when is it in the heart of the prophets? The prophets of falsehood
Who are devising to cause My people To forget My name by their dreams
The prophet with whom `is' a dream
Is it not thus? My word `is' as a fire
Therefore
Lo
Lo
And when this people
And the prophet
Thus do ye say each unto his neighbour
And the burden of Jehovah ye do not mention any more
Thus dost thou say unto the prophet What hath Jehovah answered thee? And what hath Jehovah spoken?"
And if the burden of Jehovah ye say
Therefore
And I have put on you reproach age-during
