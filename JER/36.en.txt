And it cometh to pass
`Take to thee a roll of a book
if so be the house of Israel do hear all the evil that I am thinking of doing to them
And Jeremiah calleth Baruch son of Neriah
And Jeremiah commandeth Baruch
but thou hast entered -- and thou hast read in the roll that thou hast written from my mouth
if so be their supplication doth fall before Jehovah
And Baruch son of Neriah doth according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him
And it cometh to pass
and Baruch readeth in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah
And Michaiah son of Gemariah
and he goeth down `to' the house of the king
And declare to them doth Micaiah all the words that he hath heard
and all the heads send unto Baruch
and they say unto him
and it cometh to pass
And they asked Baruch
And Baruch saith to them
And the heads say unto Baruch
And they go in unto the king
And the king sendeth Jehudi to take the roll
and the king is sitting in the winter-house
and it cometh to pass
And the king and all his servants who are hearing all these words have not been afraid
And also Elnathan
And the king commandeth Jerahmeel son of Hammelek
And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah -- after the king's burning the roll
`Turn
and unto Jehoiakim king of Judah thou dost say: Thus said Jehovah
`Therefore
and I have charged on him
And Jeremiah hath taken another roll
