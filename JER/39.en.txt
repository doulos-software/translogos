In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah
in the eleventh year of Zedekiah
and come in do all the heads of the king of Babylon
And it cometh to pass
And the forces of the Chaldeans pursue after them
And the king of Babylon slaughtereth the sons of Zedekiah
And the eyes of Zedekiah he hath blinded
And the house of the king
And the remnant of the people who are left in the city
And of the poor people
And Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon giveth a charge concerning Jeremiah
`Take him
And Nebuzar-Adan
yea
And unto Jeremiah hath a word of Jehovah been -- in his being detained in the court of the prison -- saying:"
`Go
And I have delivered thee in that day -- an affirmation of Jehovah -- and thou art not given into the hand of the men of whose face thou art afraid
for I do certainly deliver thee
