And Jehovah saith unto me: Though Moses and Samuel should stand before Me
And it hath come to pass
And I have appointed over them four kinds
And I have given them for a trembling To all kingdoms of the earth
For who hath pity on thee
Thou -- thou hast left Me -- an affirmation of Jehovah
And I scatter them with a fan
Its widows have been more to Me than the sand of the seas
Languished hath the bearer of seven
Wo to me
Jehovah said
Doth one break iron -- northern iron
Thy strength and thy treasures For a prey I do give -- not for price
And I have caused thine enemies To pass over into the land -- Thou hast not known
Thou
Thy words have been found
I have not sat in an assembly of deriders
Why hath my pain been perpetual? And my wound incurable? It hath refused to be healed
Therefore
And I have made thee to this people For a wall -- brazen -- fenced
And I have delivered thee from the hand of evil doers
