In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah
`Thus said Jehovah
If so be they hearken
`And thou hast said unto them: Thus said Jehovah
To hearken to the words of My servants the prophets
Then I have given up this house as Shiloh
And the priests
And it cometh to pass
Wherefore hast thou prophesied in the name of Jehovah
And the heads of Judah hear these things
And the priests and the prophets speak unto the heads
And Jeremiah speaketh unto all the heads
And now
`And I
Only
And the heads and all the people say unto the priests and unto the prophets
And certain of the elders of the land rise up
`Micah the Morashtite hath been prophesying in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah
`Put him at all to death did Hezekiah king of Judah
`And also there hath been a man prophesying in the name of Jehovah
And the king Jehoiakim
And the king Jehoiakim sendeth men to Egypt -- Elnathan son of Achbor
And they bring out Urijah from Egypt
Only
