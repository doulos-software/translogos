Thus said Jehovah: Lo
And I have sent to Babylon fanners
Let not the treader tread his bow
And fallen have the wounded in the land of the Chaldeans
For
Flee ye from the midst of Babylon
A golden cup `is' Babylon in the hand of Jehovah
Suddenly hath Babylon fallen
We healed Babylon
Jehovah hath brought forth our righteousnesses
Cleanse ye the arrows
Unto the walls of Babylon lift up an ensign
O dweller on many waters
Sworn hath Jehovah of Hosts by Himself
The maker of earth by His power
At the voice He giveth forth
Brutish hath been every man by knowledge
Vanity `are' they -- work of errors
Not like these `is' the portion of Jacob
An axe `art' thou to me -- weapons of war
And I have broken in pieces by thee horse and its rider
And I have broken in pieces by thee man and woman
And I have broken in pieces by thee shepherd and his drove
And I have recompensed to Babylon
Lo
And they take not out of thee a stone for a corner
Lift ye up an ensign in the land
Sanctify against it the nations with the kings of Media
And shake doth the land
Ceased have the mighty of Babylon to fight
Runner to meet runner doth run
And the passages have been captured
For thus said Jehovah of Hosts
Devoured us
My wrong
Therefore
And Babylon hath been for heaps
Together as young lions they roar
In their heat I make their banquets
I cause them to go down as lambs to slaughter
How hath Sheshach been captured
Come up against Babylon hath the sea
Its cities have been for a desolation
And I have seen after Bel in Babylon
Go forth from its midst
And lest your heart be tender
Therefore
And cried aloud against Babylon Have heavens and earth
Even Babylon `is' to fall
Ye escaped of the sword
We have been ashamed
Therefore
Because Babylon goeth up to the heavens
A voice of a cry `is' from Babylon
For Jehovah is spoiling Babylon
For come in against it -- against Babylon -- hath a spoiler
And I have caused its princes to drink
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts
The word that Jeremiah the prophet hath commanded Seraiah son of Neriah
and Jeremiah writeth all the evil that cometh unto Babylon on one book -- all these words that are written concerning Babylon."
And Jeremiah saith unto Seraiah
and hast said: Jehovah
And it hath come to pass
and said
