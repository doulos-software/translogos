A son of twenty and one years `is' Zedekiah in his reigning
and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
for
And it cometh to pass
and the city cometh into siege till the eleventh year of king Zedekiah."
In the fourth month
then is the city broken up
And the forces of the Chaldeans pursue after the king
and they capture the king
And the king of Babylon slaughtereth the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes
and the eyes of Zedekiah he hath blinded
And in the fifth month
and he burneth the house of Jehovah
and all the walls of Jerusalem round about broken down have all the forces of the Chaldeans that `are' with the chief of the executioners."
And of the poor of the people
and of the poor of the land hath Nebuzar-Adan
And the pillars of brass that `are' to the house of Jehovah
and the pots
and the basins
The two pillars
As to the pillars
And the chapiter upon it `is' of brass
And the pomegranates are ninety and six on a side
And the chief of the executioners taketh Seraiah the head priest
and out of the city he hath taken a certain eunuch
and Nebuzar-Adan
and the king of Babylon smiteth them
This `is' the people whom Nebuchadrezzar hath removed: in the seventh year
in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar -- from Jerusalem
in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar
And it cometh to pass
and speaketh with him good things
and he hath changed his prison garments
And his allowance -- a continual allowance -- hath been given to him by the king of Babylon
