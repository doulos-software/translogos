The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah
And the chief of the executioners taketh Jeremiah
and Jehovah bringeth `it' in
`And now
and while he doth not reply -- `Or turn back unto Gedaliah son of Ahikam
and Jeremiah cometh in unto Gedaliah son of Ahikam
And all the heads of the forces that `are' in the field hear
and they come in unto Gedaliah to Mizpah
And swear to them doth Gedaliah son of Ahikam
and I
And also all the Jews who `are' in Moab
and all the Jews from all the places whither they have been driven
And Johanan son of Kareah
and they say unto him
And Johanan son of Kareah hath spoken unto Gedaliah in secret
And Gedaliah son of Ahikam saith unto Johanan son of Kareah
