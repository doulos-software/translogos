And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Go
Holy `is' Israel to Jehovah
Hear a word of Jehovah
Thus said Jehovah: What -- have your fathers found in Me perversity
And have not said
Yea
The priests have not said
Therefore
For
Hath a nation changed gods? (And they `are' no gods!) And My people hath changed its honour For that which doth not profit."
Be astonished
For two evils hath My people done
A servant `is' Israel? Is he a child of the house? Wherefore hath he been for a prey?"
Against him roar do young lions
Also sons of Noph and Tahapanes Consume thee -- the crown of the head!"
Dost thou not do this to thyself? `By' thy forsaking Jehovah thy God
And now
Instruct thee doth thy wickedness
For from of old thou hast broken thy yoke
And I planted thee a choice vine
But though thou dost wash with nitre
How sayest thou
A wild ass accustomed to a wilderness
Withhold thy foot from being unshod
As the shame of a thief when he is found
Saying to wood
And where `are' thy gods
Why do ye strive with Me? All of you have transgressed against Me
In vain I have smitten your sons
O generation
Doth a virgin forget her ornaments? A bride her bands? And My people have forgotten Me days without number."
What -- dost thou make pleasing thy ways to seek love? Therefore even the wicked thou hast taught thy ways."
Also in thy skirts hath been found the blood of innocent needy souls
And thou sayest
What? thou art very vile to repeat thy way
Also from this thou goest out
