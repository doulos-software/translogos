Concerning the sons of Ammon: `Thus said Jehovah: Sons -- hath Israel none? heir -- hath he none? Wherefore hath Malcam possessed Gad? And his people in its cities have dwelt?"
Therefore
Howl
What -- dost thou boast thyself in valleys? Flowed hath thy valley
Lo
And after this I turn back the captivity of the sons of Ammon
Concerning Edom: `Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? Perished hath counsel from the intelligent? Vanished hath their wisdom?"
Flee
If gatherers have come in to thee
For I -- I have made Esau bare
Leave thine orphans -- I do keep alive
For thus said Jehovah: They whose judgment is not to drink of the cup
For
A report I have heard from Jehovah
For
Thy terribleness hath lifted thee up
And Edom hath been for a desolation
As the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah
Lo
Therefore
From the noise of their fall hath the earth shaken
Lo
Concerning Damascus: Ashamed hath been Hamath and Arpad
Feeble hath been Damascus
How is it not left -- the city of praise
Therefore fall do her young men in her broad places
And I have kindled a fire against the wall of Damascus
Concerning Kedar
Their tents and their flock they do take
Flee
Rise ye
And their camels have been for a prey
And Hazor hath been for a habitation of dragons
That which hath been the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam
`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Lo
And I have brought in to Elam four winds
And I have affrighted Elam before their enemies
And I have set My throne in Elam
And it hath come to pass
