The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah
`Hear ye the words of this covenant
and thou hast said unto them
That I commanded your fathers
In order to establish the oath that I have sworn to your fathers
And Jehovah saith unto me
For I certainly testified against your fathers
And they have not hearkened nor inclined their ear
And Jehovah saith unto me: `A conspiracy is found in the men of Judah
They have turned back to the iniquities of their first fathers
Therefore thus said Jehovah: Lo
And the cities of Judah
For -- the number of thy cities have been thy gods
And thou
What -- to My beloved in My house
`An olive
And Jehovah of Hosts
And
And I `am' as a trained lamb brought to slaughter
And O Jehovah of Hosts
Therefore
Therefore
And they have no remnant
