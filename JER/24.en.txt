Jehovah hath shewed me
In the one basket `are' figs very good
And Jehovah saith unto me
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
Thus said Jehovah
And I have set Mine eyes on them for good
And have given to them a heart to know Me
And like the bad figs
And I have given them for a trembling
And I have sent against them the sword
