And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
Thou dost not take to thee a wife
For thus said Jehovah
Of painful deaths they die
For thus said Jehovah: Do not enter the house of a mourning-feast
And died have great and small in this land
Nor do they deal out to them for mourning
A house of banqueting thou dost not enter
For thus said Jehovah of Hosts
And it hath come to pass when thou declarest to this people all these words
Then thou hast said unto them: Because that your fathers have forsaken Me
Ye also have done evil above your fathers
And I have cast you from off this land
Therefore
But
Lo
For Mine eyes `are' upon all their ways
And I have recompensed a first -- A second time -- their iniquity and their sin
O Jehovah
Doth man make for himself gods
Therefore
