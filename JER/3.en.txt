Saying
Lift thine eyes to the high places
And withheld are showers
Hast thou not henceforth called to Me
Doth He keep to the age? watch for ever?' Lo
And Jehovah saith unto me
And I say
And I see when (for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery) I have sent her away
And it hath come to pass
And even in all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned back unto Me with all her heart
And Jehovah saith unto me: `Justified herself hath backsliding Israel
Go
Only
Turn back
And I have given to you shepherds According to Mine own heart
And it hath come to pass
At that time they cry to Jerusalem
In those days do the house of Judah Go unto the house of Israel
And I have said
But -- a woman hath deceived her friend
A voice on high places is heard -- weeping
Turn back
Surely in vain from the heights
And the shameful thing hath devoured The labour of our fathers from our youth
We have lain down in our shame
