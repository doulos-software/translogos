That which hath been the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations
For Egypt
`Set ye in array shield and buckler
Gird the horses
Wherefore have I seen them dismayed -- They are turned backward
The swift do not flee
Who is this? as a flood he cometh up
Egypt
Go up
And that day `is' to the Lord Jehovah of Hosts A day of vengeance
Go up to Gilead
Nations have heard of thy shame
The word that Jehovah hath spoken unto Jeremiah the prophet concerning the coming in of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
`Declare ye in Egypt
Wherefore hath thy bull been swept away? He hath not stood
He hath multiplied the stumbling
They have cried there: Pharaoh king of Egypt `is' a desolation
I live -- an affirmation of the King
Goods for removal make for thee
A heifer very fair `is' Egypt
Even her hired ones in her midst `are' as calves of the stall
Its voice as a serpent goeth on
They have cut down her forest
Ashamed hath been the daughter of Egypt
Said hath Jehovah of Hosts
And I have given them into the hand of those seeking their life
And thou
Thou
