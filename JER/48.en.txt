Concerning Moab: `Thus said Jehovah of Hosts
There is no more praise of Moab
A voice of a cry `is' from Horonaim
Destroyed hath been Moab
For the ascent of Luhith with weeping
Flee ye
For
And come in doth a spoiler unto every city
Give wings to Moab
Cursed `is' he who is doing the work of Jehovah slothfully
Secure is Moab from his youth
Therefore
And ashamed hath been Moab because of Chemosh
How do ye say
Spoiled is Moab
Near is the calamity of Moab to come
Bemoan for him
Come down from honour
On the way stand
Put to shame hath been Moab
And judgment hath come in unto the land of the plain -- unto Holon
And on Dibon
And on Beth-Gamul
And on Kerioth
Cut down hath been the horn of Moab
Declare ye him drunk
And was not Israel the derision to thee? Among thieves was he found? For since thy words concerning him
Forsake cities
We have heard of the arrogance of Moab
I -- I have known
Therefore for Moab I howl
With the weeping of Jazer
And removed hath been joy and gladness From the fruitful field
Because of the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh
And I have caused to cease to Moab
Therefore my heart for Moab as pipes doth sound
For every head `is' bald
On all roofs of Moab
How hath it been broken down! they have howled
For thus said Jehovah: Lo
Captured have been the cities
And Moab hath been destroyed from `being' a people
Fear
Whoso is fleeing because of the fear falleth into the snare
In the shadow of Heshbon stood powerless have fugitives
Wo to thee
And I have turned back `to' the captivity of Moab
