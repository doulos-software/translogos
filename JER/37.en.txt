And reign doth king Zedekiah son of Josiah instead of Coniah son of Jehoiakim whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had caused to reign in the land of Judah
and he hath not hearkened
And Zedekiah the king sendeth Jehucal son of Shelemiah
And Jeremiah is coming in and going out in the midst of the people
and the force of Pharaoh hath come out of Egypt
And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah the prophet
`Thus said Jehovah
and the Chaldeans have turned back
`Thus said Jehovah: Lift not up your souls saying
for though ye had smitten all the force of the Chaldeans who are fighting with you
And it hath come to pass
that Jeremiah goeth out from Jerusalem to go `to' the land of Benjamin
And it cometh to pass
And Jeremiah saith
and the heads are wroth against Jeremiah
When Jeremiah hath entered into the house of the dungeon
and the king Zedekiah sendeth
And Jeremiah saith unto the king Zedekiah
And where `are' your prophets who prophesied to you
And now
And the king Zedekiah commandeth
