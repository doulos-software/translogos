At that time
And have spread them to sun
And chosen is death rather than life By all the remnant who are left of this evil family
And thou hast said unto them: Thus said Jehovah
Wherefore hath this people of Jerusalem Turned back -- a perpetual backsliding? They have kept hold on deceit
I have given attention
Even a stork in the heavens hath known her seasons
How do ye say
Ashamed have been the wise
Therefore
And they heal the breach of the daughter of my people slightly
They were ashamed when they did abomination! Yea
I utterly consume them
Wherefore are we sitting still? Be gathered
Looking for peace -- and there is no good
From Dan hath been heard the snorting of his horses
For
My refreshing for me `is' sorrow
Lo
Harvest hath passed
For a breach of the daughter of my people have I been broken
Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? For wherefore hath not the health of the daughter of my people gone up?"
