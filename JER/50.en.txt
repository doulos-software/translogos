The word that Jehovah hath spoken concerning Babylon
`Declare ye among nations
For come up against her hath a nation from the north
In those days
`To' Zion they ask the way
A perishing flock hath My people been
All finding them have devoured them
Move ye from the midst of Babylon
For
And Chaldea hath been for a spoil
Because thou rejoicest
Ashamed hath been your mother greatly
Because of the wrath of Jehovah it is not inhabited
Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about
Shout against her round about
Cut off the sower from Babylon
A scattered sheep is Israel
Therefore thus said Jehovah of Hosts
And I have brought back Israel unto his habitation
In those days
Against the land of Merathaim: Go up against it
A noise of battle `is' in the land
How hath it been cut and broken
I have laid a snare for thee
Jehovah hath opened His treasury
Come ye in to her from the extremity
Slay all her kine
A voice of fugitives and escaped ones `Is' from the land of Babylon
Summon unto Babylon archers
Therefore fall do her young men in her broad places
Lo
And stumbled hath pride
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Oppressed are the sons of Israel
Their Redeemer `is' strong
A sword `is' for the Chaldeans
A sword `is' on the princes
A sword `is' on his horses and on his chariot
A sword `is' on her waters
Therefore dwell do Ziim with Iim
As overthrown by God with Sodom
Lo
Bow and halbert they seize
Heard hath the king of Babylon their report
Lo
Therefore
From the voice: Captured was Babylon
