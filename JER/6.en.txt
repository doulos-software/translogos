Strengthen yourselves
The comely and the delicate one I have cut off
Unto her come do shepherds and their droves
Sanctify ye against her the battle
`Rise
For thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Cut down her wood
As the digging of a well
Be instructed
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: They surely glean
To whom do I speak
And with the fury of Jehovah I have been filled
And their houses have been turned to others
For from their least unto their greatest
And they heal the breach of the daughter of my people slightly
They were ashamed when they did abomination! Yea
Thus said Jehovah: Stand ye by the ways and see
And I have raised up for you watchmen
Therefore hear
Hear
Why `is' this to Me? frankincense from Sheba cometh
Therefore thus said Jehovah: Lo
Thus said Jehovah: Lo
Bow and javelin they take hold of
`We have heard its sound
Go not forth to the field
O daughter of My people
A watch-tower I have given thee
All of them are turned aside by apostates
The bellows have been burnt
`Silver rejected
