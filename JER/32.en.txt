The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah
And then the forces of the king of Babylon are laying siege against Jerusalem
Where Zedekiah king of Judah hath shut him up
And Zedekiah king of Judah doth not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans
And `to' Babylon he leadeth Zedekiah
And Jeremiah saith
Lo
And Hanameel
And I buy the field
And I write in a book
And I take the purchase-book
And I give the purchase-book unto Baruch son of Neriah
And I charge Baruch before their eyes
`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts
For thus said Jehovah of Hosts
And I pray unto Jehovah -- after my giving the purchase-book unto Baruch son of Neriah -- saying
`Ah
Doing kindness to thousands
Great in counsel
In that thou hast done signs and wonders in the land of Egypt unto this day
`And Thou bringest forth Thy people Israel from the land of Egypt
And thou givest to them this land that thou didst swear to their fathers to give to them
And they come in
`Lo
Yet Thou hast said unto me
And the word of Jehovah is unto Jeremiah
`Lo
`Therefore
And come in have the Chaldeans who are fighting against this city
For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have been only doing evil in Mine eyes
`For a cause of Mine anger
Because of all the evil of the sons of Israel
And they turn unto Me the neck
`And they set their abominations in the house over which My name is called
And they build the high places of Baal
`And now
Lo
and they have been to Me for a people
and I have given to them one heart
and I have made for them a covenant age-during
and I have rejoiced over them to do them good
`For thus said Jehovah: As I brought in unto this people all this great evil
and bought hath been the field in this land of which ye are saying
Fields with money they buy
