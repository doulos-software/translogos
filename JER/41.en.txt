And it cometh to pass
And Ishmael son of Nethaniah riseth
And all the Jews who have been with him
And it cometh to pass
that men come in from Shechem
And Ishmael son of Nethaniah goeth forth to meet them
And it cometh to pass
And ten men have been found among them
And the pit whither Ishmael hath cast all the carcases of the men whom he hath smitten along with Gedaliah
And Ishmael taketh captive all the remnant of the people who `are' in Mizpah
And hear doth Johanan son of Kareah
and they take all the men
And it cometh to pass
And all the people whom Ishmael hath taken captive from Mizpah turn round
And Ishmael son of Nethaniah hath escaped
And Johanan son of Kareah
and they go and abide in the habitations of Chimham
from the presence of the Chaldeans
