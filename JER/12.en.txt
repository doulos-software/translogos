Righteous `art' Thou
Thou hast planted them
And Thou
Till when doth the earth mourn
For -- with footmen thou hast run
For even thy brethren and the house of thy father
I have forsaken My house
Mine inheritance hath been to Me as a lion in a forest
A speckled fowl `is' Mine inheritance to Me? Is the fowl round about against her? Come
Many shepherds did destroy My vineyard
He hath made it become a desolation
On all high places in the plain have spoilers come in
They sowed wheat
Thus said Jehovah concerning all my evil neighbours
And it hath been
And it hath come to pass
And if they do not hearken
