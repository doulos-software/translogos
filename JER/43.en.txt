And it cometh to pass
that Azariah son of Hoshaiah
for Baruch son of Neriah is moving thee against us
And Johanan son of Kareah
and Johanan son of Kareah
the men
and they enter the land of Egypt
And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes
`Take in thy hand great stones
and thou hast said unto them: Thus said Jehovah of Hosts
and he hath come
And I have kindled a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt
and he hath broken the standing pillars of the house of the sun
