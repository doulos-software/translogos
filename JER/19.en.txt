Thus said Jehovah
and thou hast gone forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom
and hast said
because that they have forsaken Me
and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons with fire
`Therefore
And I have made void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place
and I have made this city for a desolation
And I have caused them to eat the flesh of their sons
`And thou hast broken the bottle before the eyes of the men who are going with thee
and hast said unto them: Thus said Jehovah of Hosts
so I do to this place -- an affirmation of Jehovah -- and to its inhabitants
and the houses of Jerusalem
And Jeremiah cometh in from Tophet
`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts
