Thus said Jehovah unto me
and I get the girdle
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me a second time
`Take the girdle that thou hast got
and I go and hide it by Phrat
And it cometh to pass
and I go to Phrat
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
Thus do I mar the excellency of Judah
This evil people
For
And thou hast said unto them this word
And thou hast said unto them
And have dashed them one against another
Hear
Give ye to Jehovah your God honour
And if ye do not hear it
Say to the king and to the mistress: Make yourselves low -- sit still
The cities of the south have been shut up
Lift up your eyes
What dost thou say
And when thou dost say in thy heart
Doth a Cushite change his skin? and a leopard his spots? Ye also are able to do good
And I scatter them as stubble
This `is' thy lot
I also have made bare thy skirts before thy face
Thine adulteries
