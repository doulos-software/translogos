At that time
Thus said Jehovah: Found grace in the wilderness Hath a people remaining from the sword Going to cause it to rest -- Israel."
From afar Jehovah hath appeared to me
Again do I build thee
Again thou dost plant vineyards In mountains of Samaria
For there is a day
For thus said Jehovah: Sing
Lo
With weeping they come in
Hear a word of Jehovah
For Jehovah hath ransomed Jacob
And they have come in
Then rejoice doth a virgin in a chorus
And satisfied the soul of the priests `with' fatness
Thus said Jehovah
Thus said Jehovah: Withhold thy voice from weeping
And there is hope for thy latter end
I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself
For after my turning back I repented
A precious son is Ephraim to Me? A child of delights? For since My speaking against him
Set up for thee signs
Till when dost thou withdraw thyself
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts
And dwelt in Judah have husbandmen
For I have satiated the weary soul
On this I have awaked
Lo
And it hath been
In those days they do not say any more: Fathers have eaten unripe fruit
But -- each for his own iniquity doth die
Lo
Not like the covenant that I made with their fathers
For this `is' the covenant that I make
And they do not teach any more Each his neighbour
Thus said Jehovah
If these statutes depart from before Me
Thus said Jehovah: If the heavens above be measured
Lo
And gone out again hath the measuring line Over-against it
And all the valley of the carcases and of the ashes
