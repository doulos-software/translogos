The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah
Rise
and I go down `to' the potter's house
and marred is the vessel that he is making
And there is a word of Jehovah to me
As this potter am I not able to do to you? O house of Israel
The moment I speak concerning a nation
And that nation hath turned from its evil
And the moment I speak concerning a nation
And it hath done the evil thing in Mine eyes
And now
And they have said
Therefore
Doth snow of Lebanon Cease from the rock of the field? Failed are the cold strange waters that flow?"
But My people have forgotten Me
To make their land become a desolation
As an east wind I scatter them before an enemy
And they say
Give attention
Is evil recompensed instead of good
Therefore
A cry is heard from their houses
And Thou
