And these `are' words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the remnant of the elders of the removal
After the going forth of Jeconiah the king
By the hand of Eleasah son of Shaphan
`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts
Build ye houses
Take ye wives
And seek the peace of the city whither I have removed you
`For thus said Jehovah of Hosts
For with falsehood they are prophesying to you in My name; I have not sent them
`For thus said Jehovah
For I have known the thoughts that I am thinking towards you -- an affirmation of Jehovah; thoughts of peace
`And ye have called Me
And ye have sought Me
And I have been found of you -- an affirmation of Jehovah; and I have turned back `to' your captivity
`Because ye have said
Surely thus said Jehovah concerning the king who is sitting on the throne of David
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts
And I have pursued after them with sword
Because that they have not hearkened unto My words -- an affirmation of Jehovah -- that I sent unto them by My servants the prophets
`And ye
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts
And taken from them hath been a reviling by all the removed of Judah that `are' in Babylon
Because that they have done folly in Israel
`And unto Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou dost speak
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts
Jehovah hath made thee priest instead of Jehoiada the priest
And now
Because that he hath sent unto us to Babylon
And Zephaniah the priest readeth this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet."
And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah
`Send unto all the removal
Therefore
