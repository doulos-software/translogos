If thou dost turn back
And thou hast sworn -- Jehovah liveth
For thus said Jehovah
Be circumcised to Jehovah
Declare in Judah
Lift up an ensign Zionward
Gone up hath a lion from his thicket
For this
And it hath come to pass
And I say
At that time it is said of this people
A full wind from these doth come for Me
Lo
Wash from evil thy heart
For a voice is declaring from Dan
Make ye mention to the nations
As the keepers of a field They have been against her round about
Thy way and thy doings have done these to thee
My bowels
Destruction on destruction is proclaimed
Till when do I see an ensign? Do I hear the voice of a trumpet?"
For my people `are' foolish
I looked `to' the land
I have looked `to' the mountains
I have looked
I have looked
For thus said Jehovah: All the land is a desolation
For this doth the land mourn
From the voice of the horseman
And thou
For a voice as of a sick woman I have heard
