Thus said Jehovah
Hear a word of Jehovah
Thus said Jehovah: Do ye judgment and righteousness
For
And if ye do not hear these words
For thus said Jehovah
And I have separated for thee destroyers
And many nations have passed by this city
And they have said
Ye do not weep for the dead
For thus said Jehovah concerning Shallum son of Josiah king of Judah
For in the place whither they have removed him he dieth
Wo to him who is building his house by unrighteousness
Who is saying
Dost thou reign
He decided the cause of the poor and needy
But thine eyes and thy heart are not
Therefore
The burial of an ass -- he is buried
Go up to Lebanon
I have spoken unto thee in thine ease
All thy friends consume doth wind
O dweller in Lebanon
I live -- an affirmation of Jehovah
And I have given thee into the hand of those seeking thy life
And I have cast thee
And to the land whither they are lifting up their soul to return
A grief -- a despised broken thing -- is this man Coniah? A vessel in which there is no pleasure? Wherefore have they been cast up and down
Earth
Thus said Jehovah: Write ye this man childless
