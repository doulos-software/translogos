And Shephatiah son of Mattan
`Thus said Jehovah: He who is remaining in this city dieth
Thus said Jehovah: This city is certainly given into the hand of the force of the king of Babylon
And the heads say unto the king
And the king Zedekiah saith
And they take Jeremiah
And Ebed-Melech the Cushite
and Ebed-Melech goeth forth from the king's house
`My lord
And the king commandeth Ebed-Melech the Cushite
And Ebed-Melech taketh the men with him
And Ebed-Melech the Cushite saith unto Jeremiah
and they draw out Jeremiah with cords
And the king Zedekiah sendeth
And Jeremiah saith unto Zedekiah
And the king Zedekiah sweareth unto Jeremiah in secret
And Jeremiah saith unto Zedekiah
And if thou dost not go forth unto the heads of the king of Babylon
And the king Zedekiah saith unto Jeremiah
And Jeremiah saith
`And if thou art refusing to go forth
That
`And all thy wives
And Zedekiah saith unto Jeremiah
and when the heads hear that I have spoken with thee
then thou hast said unto them
And all the heads come in unto Jeremiah
and Jeremiah dwelleth in the court of the prison till the day that Jerusalem hath been captured
