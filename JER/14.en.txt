That which hath been the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah concerning the matters of the dearths:"
Mourned hath Judah
And their honourable ones have sent their little ones to the water
Because the ground hath been broken
For even the hind in the field hath brought forth -- to forsake `it!' For there hath been no grass."
And wild asses have stood on high places
Surely our iniquities have testified against us
O Hope of Israel -- its saviour in time of trouble
Why art Thou as one dumb? As a mighty one not able to save? And Thou `art' in our midst
Thus said Jehovah concerning this people: Well they have loved to wander
And Jehovah saith unto me: Thou dost not pray for this people for good
When they fast
And I say
And Jehovah saith unto me: Falsehood the prophets are prophesying in My name
Therefore
And the people to whom they are prophesying
And thou hast said unto them this word: Tears come down mine eyes night and day
If I have gone forth to the field
Hast Thou utterly rejected Judah? Zion hath Thy soul loathed? Wherefore hast Thou smitten us
We have known
Do not despise
Are there among the vanities of the nations any causing rain? And do the heavens give showers? Art not Thou He
