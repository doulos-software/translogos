And it cometh to pass
`Thus spake Jehovah of Hosts
Within two years of days I am bringing back unto this place all the vessels of the house of Jehovah that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon hath taken from this place
And Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim
And Jeremiah the prophet saith unto Hananiah the prophet
Yea
`Only
The prophets who have been before me
The prophet who doth prophesy of peace -- by the coming in of the word of the prophet
And Hananiah the prophet taketh the yoke from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet
And Hananiah speaketh before the eyes of all the people
And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah after the breaking
`Go
For thus said Jehovah of Hosts
And Jeremiah the prophet saith unto Hananiah the prophet
Therefore thus said Jehovah
And Hananiah the prophet dieth in that year
