The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah
`Inquire
And Jeremiah saith unto them
Thus said Jehovah
And I -- I have fought against you
And I have smitten the inhabitants of this city
And after this -- an affirmation of Jehovah
And unto this people thou dost say
Whoso is abiding in this city -- dieth
For I have set My face against this city for evil
And as to the house of the king of Judah
O house of David
Lo
And I have laid a charge against you
