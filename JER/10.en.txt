Hear ye the word
Thus said Jehovah: Unto the way of the nations accustom not yourselves
For the statutes of the peoples are vanity
With silver and with gold they beautify it
As a palm they `are' stiff
Because there is none like Thee
Who doth not fear Thee
And in one they are brutish and foolish
Spread-out silver from Tarshish is brought
And Jehovah `is' a God of truth
Thus do ye say to them
The maker of the earth by His power
At the voice He giveth forth
Brutish is every man by knowledge
Vanity `are' they
Not like these `is' the Portion of Jacob
Gather from the land thy merchandise
For thus said Jehovah: Lo
Wo to me for my breaking
My tent hath been spoiled
For the shepherds have become brutish
A voice of a report
I have known
Chastise me
Pour out Thy fury on the nations that have not known Thee
