Go to and fro in streets of Jerusalem
And if they say
Jehovah
And I -- I said
I get me to the great
Therefore smitten them hath a lion out of the forest
For this I am not propitious to thee
Fed horses -- they have been early risers
For these do I not lay a charge? An affirmation of Jehovah
Go ye up on her walls
For dealt treacherously against Me have the house of Israel
They have lied against Jehovah
And the prophets become wind
Therefore
Lo
Its quiver `is' as an open sepulchre
And it hath consumed thy harvest and thy bread
And even in those days
And it hath come to pass
Declare ye this in the house of Jacob
Hear ye
Me do ye not fear
And this people hath an apostate and rebellious heart
And they have not said in their heart
Your iniquities have turned these away
For the wicked have been found among My people. It looketh about the covering of snares
As a cage full of fowls
They have been fat
For these do not I inspect
An astonishing and horrible thing hath been in the land."
The prophets have prophesied falsely
