In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah
`Thus said Jehovah unto me
And thou hast put them on thy neck
And thou hast commanded them for their lords
Thus do ye say unto your lords
`And now
And served him have all the nations
And it hath come to pass
`And ye
For falsehood they are prophesying to you
And the nation that causeth its neck to enter into the yoke of the king of Babylon
And unto Zedekiah king of Judah I have spoken according to all these words
Why do ye die
`And ye do not hearken unto the words of the prophets who are speaking unto you
For I have not sent them -- an affirmation of Jehovah -- and they are prophesying in My name falsely
And unto the priests
Ye do not hearken unto them
`And
For thus said Jehovah of Hosts concerning the pillars
That Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon hath not taken
Surely thus said Jehovah of Hosts
To Babylon they are brought
