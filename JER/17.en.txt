The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron
As their sons remember their altars and their shrines
O My mountain in the field -- thy strength
And thou hast let go -- even through thyself
Thus said Jehovah: Cursed `is' the man who doth trust in man
And he hath been as a naked thing in a desert
Blessed `is' the man who trusteth in Jehovah
And hath been as a tree planted by waters
Crooked `is' the heart above all things
I Jehovah do search the heart
A partridge hatching
A throne of honour on high from the beginning
The hope of Israel `is' Jehovah
Heal me
Lo
And I hastened not from feeding after Thee
Be not Thou to me for a terror
Let my pursuers be ashamed
Thus said Jehovah unto me: `Go
and thou hast said unto them: Hear a word of Jehovah
Thus said Jehovah
Nor do ye take out a burden from your houses on the day of rest
And they have not hearkened nor inclined their ear
And it hath been
Then entered by the gates of this city have kings and princes
And they have come in from cities of Judah
And if ye do not hearken unto me to sanctify the day of rest
