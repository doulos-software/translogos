The word that hath been unto Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah
Which Jeremiah the prophet hath spoken concerning all the people of Judah
`From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah
And Jehovah hath sent unto you all His servants
`Turn back
And ye do not go after other gods to serve them
And ye have not hearkened unto Me -- an affirmation of Jehovah -- so as to provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands for evil to you."
`Therefore thus said Jehovah of Hosts
Lo
And I have destroyed from them the voice of rejoicing
And all this land hath been for a waste
`And it hath come to pass
And I have brought in on that land all My words that I have spoken against it
For laid service on them -- also them -- have many nations and great kings
`For thus said Jehovah God of Israel unto me
And they have drunk
`And I take the cup out of the hand of Jehovah
Jerusalem
Pharaoh king of Egypt
And all the mixed people
Edom
And all the kings of Tyre
Dedan
And all the kings of Arabia
And all the kings of Zimri
And all the kings of the north
And thou hast said unto them: Thus said Jehovah of Hosts God of Israel
And it hath come to pass
For lo
And thou
Wasting hath come unto the end of the earth
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Lo
And the pierced of Jehovah have been in that day
Howl
And perished hath refuge from the shepherds
A voice `is' of the cry of the shepherds
And the peaceable habitations have been cut down
He hath forsaken
