Words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah
unto whom the word of Jehovah hath been in the days of Josiah son of Amon
and it is in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
`Before I form thee in the belly
And I say
And Jehovah saith unto me
Be not afraid of their faces
And Jehovah putteth forth His hand
See
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me
And Jehovah saith unto me
And there is a word of Jehovah unto me a second time
And Jehovah saith unto me
For
And I have spoken My judgments with them concerning all their evil
`And thou
And I
and they have fought against thee
