Wo `to' those devising iniquity
And they have desired fields
Therefore
In that day doth `one' take up for you a simile
Therefore
Ye do not prophesy -- they do prophesy
Doth the house of Jacob say
And yesterday My people for an enemy doth raise himself up
The women of My people ye cast out from its delightful house
Rise and go
If one is going `with' the wind
I do surely gather thee
Gone up hath the breaker before them
