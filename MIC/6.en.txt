O My people
For I brought thee up from the land of Egypt
O My people
With what do I come before Jehovah? Do I bow to God Most High? Do I come before Him with burnt-offerings? With calves -- sons of a year?"
Is Jehovah pleased with thousands of rams? With myriads of streams of oil? Do I give my first-born `for' my transgression? The fruit of my body `for' the sin of my soul?"
He hath declared to thee
A voice of Jehovah to the city calleth
Are there yet `in' the house of the wicked Treasures of wickedness
Do I reckon `it' pure with balances of wickedness? And with a bag of deceitful stones?"
Whose rich ones have been full of violence
And I also
Thou -- thou eatest
Thou -- thou sowest
And kept habitually are the statutes of Omri
