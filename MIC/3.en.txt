And I say
Ye who are hating good
And who have eaten the flesh of My people
Then do they cry unto Jehovah
Thus said Jehovah concerning the prophets Who are causing My people to err
Therefore a night ye have without vision
And ashamed have been the seers
And yet I have been full of power by the Spirit of Jehovah
Hear this
Building up Zion with blood
Her heads for a bribe do judge
Therefore
