A word of Jehovah that hath been unto Micah the Morashite in the days of Jotham
Hear
For lo
Melted have been the mountains under Him
For the transgression of Jacob `is' all this
And I have set Samaria for a heap of the field
And all her graven images are beaten down
For this I lament and howl
For mortal `are' her wounds
In Gath tell ye not -- in Acco weep not
Pass over for thee
For stayed for good hath the inhabitant of Maroth
Bind the chariot to a swift beast
Therefore thou givest presents to Moresheth-Gath
Yet the possessor I do bring in to thee
Make bald and shave
