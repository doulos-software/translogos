Now gather thyself together
And thou
Therefore he doth give them out till the time She who bringeth forth hath brought forth
And he hath stood and delighted in the strength of Jehovah
And this `one' hath been peace
And they have afflicted the land of Asshur with the sword
And the remnant of Jacob hath been in the midst of many peoples
Yea
High is thy hand above thine adversaries
And it hath come to pass in that day
And I have cut off the cities of thy land
And have cut off sorcerers out of thy hand
And I have cut off thy graven images
And I have plucked up thy shrines out of thy midst
And I have done vengeance in anger and in fury
