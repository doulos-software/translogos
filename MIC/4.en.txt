And it hath come to pass
And gone have many nations and said
And He hath judged between many peoples
And they have sat each under his vine
For all the peoples do walk
In that day -- an affirmation of Jehovah
And I have set the halting for a remnant
And thou
Now
Be pained
And now
They have not known the thoughts of Jehovah
Arise
