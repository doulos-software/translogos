My wo `is' to me
Perished hath the kind out of the land
On the evil `are' both hands to do `it' well
Their best one `is' as a brier
Believe not in a friend
For a son is dishonouring a father
And I -- in Jehovah I do watch
Thou dost not rejoice over me
The indignation of Jehovah I do bear
And see doth mine enemy
The day to build thy walls! That day -- removed is the limit."
That day -- even unto thee it doth come in
And the land hath been for a desolation
Rule Thou Thy people with Thy rod
According to the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt
See do nations
They lick dust as a serpent
Who `is' a God like Thee? taking away iniquity
He doth turn back
Thou givest truth to Jacob
