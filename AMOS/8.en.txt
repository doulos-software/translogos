Thus hath the Lord Jehovah shewed me
And He saith
And howled have songstresses of a palace in that day
Hear this
Saying
To purchase with money the poor
Sworn hath Jehovah by the excellency of Jacob: `I forget not for ever any of their works."
For this doth not the land tremble
And it hath come to pass in that day
And have turned your festivals to mourning
Lo
And they have wandered from sea unto sea
In that day faint do the fair virgins
Those swearing by the guilt of Samaria
