Hear this word that I am bearing to you
`Fallen
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: The city that is going out a thousand
For thus said Jehovah to the house of Israel: Seek ye Me
And seek not Beth-El
Seek ye Jehovah
Ye who are turning to wormwood judgment
The maker of Kimah and Kesil
Who is brightening up the spoiled against the strong
They have hated a reprover in the gate
Therefore
For I have known -- many `are' your transgressions
Therefore is the wise at that time silent
Seek good
Hate evil
Therefore
And in all vineyards `is' lamentation
Ho
As `when' one fleeth from the face of the lion
Is not the day of Jehovah darkness and not light
I have hated -- I have loathed your festivals
For though ye cause burnt-offerings and your presents to ascend to Me
Turn aside from Me the noise of thy songs
And roll on as waters doth judgment
Sacrifices and offering did ye bring nigh to Me
And ye bare Succoth your king
And I removed you beyond Damascus
