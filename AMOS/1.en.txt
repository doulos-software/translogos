Words of Amos -- who hath been among herdsmen of Tekoa -- that he hath seen concerning Israel
and he saith: Jehovah from Zion doth roar
And thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Damascus
And I have sent a fire against the house of Hazael
And I have broken the bar of Damascus
Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Gaza
And I have sent a fire against the wall of Gaza
And I have cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod
Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Tyre
And I have sent a fire against the wall of Tyre
Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Edom
And I have sent a fire against Teman
Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon
And I have kindled a fire against the wall of Rabbah
And gone hath their king in a removal
