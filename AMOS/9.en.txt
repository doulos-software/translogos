I have seen the Lord standing by the altar
If they dig through into sheol
And if they be hid in the top of Carmel
And if they go into captivity before their enemies
And `it is' the Lord
Who is building in the heavens His upper chambers; As to His troop
As sons of Cushim are ye not to Me? O sons of Israel -- an affirmation of Jehovah. Israel did I not bring up out of the land of Egypt? And the Philistines from Caphtor
Lo
For lo
By sword die do all sinners of My people
In that day I raise the tabernacle of David
So that they possess the remnant of Edom
Lo
And I have turned back `to' the captivity of My people Israel
And I have planted them on their own ground
