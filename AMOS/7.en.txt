Thus hath the Lord Jehovah shewed me
and it hath come to pass
Jehovah hath repented of this
Thus hath the Lord Jehovah shewed me
`Lord Jehovah
Jehovah hath repented of this
Thus hath He shewed me
and Jehovah saith unto me
And desolated have been high places of Isaac
And Amaziah priest of Beth-El sendeth unto Jeroboam king of Israel
for thus said Amos: By sword die doth Jeroboam
And Amaziah saith unto Amos
and `at' Beth-El do not add to prophesy any more
And Amos answereth and saith unto Amaziah
and Jehovah taketh me from after the flock
And now
therefore thus said Jehovah: Thy wife in the city doth go a-whoring
