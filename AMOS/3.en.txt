Hear ye this word that Jehovah hath spoken concerning you
Only you I have known of all families of the land
Do two walk together if they have not met?"
Roar doth a lion in a forest and prey he hath none? Give out doth a young lion his voice from his habitation
Doth a bird fall into a snare of the earth
Is a trumpet blown in a city
For the Lord Jehovah doth nothing
A lion hath roared -- who doth not fear? The Lord Jehovah hath spoken -- who doth not prophesy?"
Sound ye unto palaces in Ashdod
And they have not known to act straightforwardly
Therefore
Thus said Jehovah: As the shepherd delivereth from the lion's mouth Two legs
Hear ye and testify to the house of Jacob
For in the day of My charging the transgressions of Israel on him
And I have smitten the winter-house with the summer-house
