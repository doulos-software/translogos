Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Moab
And I have sent a fire against Moab
And I have cut off a judge from her midst
Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah
And I have sent a fire against Judah
Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel
Who are panting for the dust of the earth on the head of the poor
And on pledged garments they stretch themselves near every altar
And I -- I have destroyed the Amorite from before them
And I -- I have brought you up from the land of Egypt
And I raise of your sons for prophets
And ye cause the Nazarites to drink wine
Lo
And perished hath refuge from the swift
And the handler of the bow standeth not
And the courageous of heart among the mighty
