Wo `to' those secure in Zion
Pass ye over `to' Calneh and see
Who are putting away the day of evil
Who are lying down on beds of ivory
Who are taking part according to the psaltery
Who are drinking with bowls of wine
Therefore now they remove at the head of the captives
Sworn hath the Lord Jehovah by Himself
And if there are left ten persons in one house
And lifted him up hath his loved one
For lo
Do horses run on a rock? Doth one plough `it' with oxen? For ye have turned to gall judgment
O ye who are rejoicing at nothing
Surely
