The children! obey your parents in the Lord
honour thy father and mother
which is the first command with a promise
And the fathers! provoke not your children
The servants! obey the masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling
not with eye-service as men-pleasers
with good-will serving
having known that whatever good thing each one may do
And the masters! the same things do ye unto them
As to the rest
put on the whole armour of God
because we have not the wrestling with blood and flesh
because of this take ye up the whole armour of God
Stand
and having the feet shod in the preparation of the good-news of the peace;"
above all
and the helmet of the salvation receive
through all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the Spirit
and in behalf of me
for which I am an ambassador in a chain
And that ye may know -- ye also -- the things concerning me -- what I do
whom I did send unto you for this very thing
Peace to the brethren
The grace with all those loving our Lord Jesus Christ -- undecayingly! Amen."
