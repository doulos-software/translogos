Paul
Grace to you
Blessed `is' the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
according as He did choose us in him before the foundation of the world
having foreordained us to the adoption of sons through Jesus Christ to Himself
to the praise of the glory of His grace
in whom we have the redemption through his blood
in which He did abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence
having made known to us the secret of His will
in regard to the dispensation of the fulness of the times
in whom also we did obtain an inheritance
for our being to the praise of His glory
in whom ye also
which is an earnest of our inheritance
Because of this I also
do not cease giving thanks for you
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ
the eyes of your understanding being enlightened
and what the exceeding greatness of His power to us who are believing
which He wrought in the Christ
far above all principality
and all things He did put under his feet
which is his body
