Call upon you
with all lowliness and meekness
being diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of the peace;"
one body and one Spirit
one Lord
one God and Father of all
and to each one of you was given the grace
wherefore
and that
he who went down is the same also who went up far above all the heavens
and He gave some `as' apostles
unto the perfecting of the saints
till we may all come to the unity of the faith and of the recognition of the Son of God
that we may no more be babes
and
from whom the whole body
This
being darkened in the understanding
who
and ye did not so learn the Christ
if so be ye did hear him
ye are to put off concerning the former behaviour the old man
and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind
and to put on the new man
Wherefore
be angry and do not sin; let not the sun go down upon your wrath
neither give place to the devil;"
whoso is stealing let him no more steal
Let no corrupt word out of your mouth go forth
and make not sorrowful the Holy Spirit of God
Let all bitterness
and become one to another kind
