Also you -- being dead in the trespasses and the sins
in which once ye did walk according to the age of this world
among whom also we all did walk once in the desires of our flesh
and God
even being dead in the trespasses
and did raise `us' up together
that He might show
for by grace ye are having been saved
not of works
for of Him we are workmanship
Wherefore
that ye were at that time apart from Christ
and now
for he is our peace
the enmity in his flesh
and might reconcile both in one body to God through the cross
and having come
because through him we have the access -- we both -- in one Spirit unto the Father."
Then
being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets
in whom all the building fitly framed together doth increase to an holy sanctuary in the Lord
in whom also ye are builded together
