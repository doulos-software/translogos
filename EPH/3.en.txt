For this cause
if
that by revelation He made known to me the secret
in regard to which ye are able
which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men
that the nations be fellow-heirs
of which I became a ministrant
to me -- the less than the least of all the saints -- was given this grace
and to cause all to see what `is' the fellowship of the secret that hath been hid from the ages in God
that there might be made known now to the principalities and the authorities in the heavenly `places'
according to a purpose of the ages
in whom we have the freedom and the access in confidence through the faith of him
wherefore
For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
of whom the whole family in the heavens and on earth is named
that He may give to you
that the Christ may dwell through the faith in your hearts
that ye may be in strength to comprehend
to know also the love of the Christ that is exceeding the knowledge
and to Him who is able above all things to do exceeding abundantly what we ask or think
to Him `is' the glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus
