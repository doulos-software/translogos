who
but did empty himself
and in fashion having been found as a man
wherefore
that in the name of Jesus every knee may bow -- of heavenlies
and every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ `is' Lord
So that
for God it is who is working in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure."
All things do without murmurings and reasonings
that ye may become blameless and harmless
the word of life holding forth
but if also I am poured forth upon the sacrifice and service of your faith
because of this do ye also rejoice and joy with me."
And I hope
for I have no one like-minded
for the whole seek their own things
and the proof of him ye know
him
and I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall quickly come."
And I thought `it' necessary Epaphroditus -- my brother
seeing he was longing after you all
for he also ailed nigh to death
The more eagerly
receive him
because on account of the work of the Christ he drew near to death
