Paul and Timotheus

always
for your contribution to the good news from the first day till now

so that my bonds have become manifest in Christ in the whole praetorium
and the greater part of the brethren in the Lord
Certain

and to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account
and of this being persuaded
that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence again to you."
Only worthily of the good news of the Christ conduct ye yourselves
and not terrified in anything by those opposing
because to you it was granted
the same conflict having
