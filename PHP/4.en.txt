So then
Euodia I exhort
and I ask also thee
Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say
let your forbearance be known to all men; the Lord `is' near;"
for nothing be anxious
and the peace of God
As to the rest
the things that also ye did learn
And I rejoiced in the Lord greatly
not that in respect of want I say `it'
I have known both to be abased
For all things I have strength
but ye did well
and ye have known
because also in Thessalonica
not that I seek after the gift
and I have all things
and my God shall supply all your need
and to God
Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus; there salute you the brethren with me;"
there salute you all the saints
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ `is' with you all. Amen."
