As to the rest
look to the dogs
for we are the circumcision
though I also have `cause of' trust in flesh. If any other one doth think to have trust in flesh
circumcision on the eighth day! of the race of Israel! of the tribe of Benjamin! a Hebrew of Hebrews! according to law a Pharisee!"
according to zeal persecuting the assembly! according to righteousness that is in law becoming blameless!"
But what things were to me gains
yes
not having my righteousness
to know him
if anyhow I may attain to the rising again of the dead."
Not that I did already obtain
brethren
to the mark I pursue for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
As many
but to what we have come -- by the same rule walk
become followers together of me
for many walk of whom many times I told you -- and now also weeping tell -- the enemies of the cross of the Christ!"
whose end `is' destruction
For our citizenship is in the heavens
who shall transform the body of our humiliation to its becoming conformed to the body of his glory
