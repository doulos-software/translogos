And all the tax-gatherers and the sinners were coming nigh to him
and the Pharisees and the scribes were murmuring
And he spake unto them this simile
`What man of you having a hundred sheep
and having found
and having come to the house
`I say to you
`Or what woman having ten drachms
and having found
`So I say to you
And he said
and the younger of them said to the father
`And not many days after
and he having spent all
and having gone on
and he was desirous to fill his belly from the husks that the swine were eating
`And having come to himself
having risen
and no more am I worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hirelings."
`And having risen
and the son said to him
`And the father said unto his servants
and having brought the fatted calf
because this my son was dead
`And his elder son was in a field
and having called near one of the young men
and he said to him -- Thy brother is arrived
`And he was angry
and he answering said to the father
but when thy son -- this one who did devour thy living with harlots -- came
`And he said to him
but to be merry
