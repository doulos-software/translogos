And it came to pass
And he said to them
our appointed bread be giving us daily;"
and forgive us our sins
And he said unto them
seeing a friend of mine came out of the way unto me
and he from within answering may say
`I say to you
and I say to you
for every one who is asking doth receive; and he who is seeking doth find; and to him who is knocking it shall be opened."
`And of which of you -- the father -- if the son shall ask a loaf
and if he may ask an egg
If
And he was casting forth a demon
and certain of them said
and others
And he
and if also the Adversary against himself was divided
`But if I by Beelzeboul cast forth the demons -- your sons
but if by the finger of God I cast forth the demons
`When the strong man armed may keep his hall
but when the stronger than he
he who is not with me is against me
`When the unclean spirit may go forth from the man it walketh through waterless places seeking rest
and having come
then doth it go
And it came to pass
And he said
And the multitudes crowding together upon him
for as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites
`A queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation
`Men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation
`And no one having lighted a lamp
`The lamp of the body is the eye
take heed
if then thy whole body is lightened
And in `his' speaking
and the Pharisee having seen
And the Lord said unto him
unthinking! did not He who made the outside also the inside make?"
But what ye have give ye `as' alms
`But wo to you
`Wo to you
`Wo to you
And one of the lawyers answering
and he said
`Wo to you
Then do ye testify
because of this also the wisdom of God said: I will send to them prophets
that the blood of all the prophets
from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias
`Wo to you
And in his speaking these things unto them
laying wait for him
