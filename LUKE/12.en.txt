At which time the myriads of the multitude having been gathered together
and there is nothing covered
because whatever in the darkness ye said
`And I say to you
but I will show to you
`Are not five sparrows sold for two assars? and one of them is not forgotten before God
but even the hairs of your head have been all numbered; therefore fear ye not
`And I say to you
and he who hath denied me before men
and every one whoever shall say a word to the Son of Man
`And when they bring you before the synagogues
for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that hour what it behoveth `you' to say.'"
And a certain one said to him
And he said to him
And he said unto them
And he spake a simile unto them
and he was reasoning within himself
and he said
and I will say to my soul
`And God said to him
so `is' he who is treasuring up to himself
And he said unto his disciples
the life is more than the nourishment
`Consider the ravens
and who of you
If
`Consider the lilies
and if the herbage in the field
`And ye -- seek not what ye may eat
for all these things do the nations of the world seek after
but
`Fear not
sell your goods
for where your treasure is
`Let your loins be girded
and ye like to men waiting for their lord
`Happy those servants
and if he may come in the second watch
`And this know
and ye
And Peter said to him
And the Lord said
Happy that servant
truly I say to you
`And if that servant may say in his heart
the lord of that servant will come in a day in which he doth not look for `him'
`And that servant
and he who
`Fire I came to cast to the earth
but I have a baptism to be baptized with
`Think ye that peace I came to give in the earth? no
for there shall be henceforth five in one house divided -- three against two
a father shall be divided against a son
And he said also to the multitudes
and when -- a south wind blowing
hypocrites! the face of the earth and of the heaven ye have known to make proof of
`And why
for
I say to thee
