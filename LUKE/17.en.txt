And he said unto the disciples
it is more profitable to him if a weighty millstone is put round about his neck
`Take heed to yourselves
and if seven times in the day he may sin against thee
And the apostles said to the Lord
and the Lord said
`But
but will not `rather' say to him
Hath he favour to that servant because he did the things directed? I think not."
`So also ye
And it came to pass
and he entering into a certain village
and they lifted up the voice
and having seen `them'
and one of them having seen that he was healed did turn back
and he fell upon `his' face at his feet
And Jesus answering said
There were not found who did turn back to give glory to God
and he said to him
And having been questioned by the Pharisees
nor shall they say
And he said unto his disciples
and they shall say to you
for as the lightning that is lightening out of the one `part' under heaven
and first it behoveth him to suffer many things
`And
they were eating
in like manner also
and on the day Lot went forth from Sodom
`According to these things it shall be
in that day
remember the wife of Lot."
Whoever may seek to save his life
`I say to you
two women shall be grinding at the same place together
two men shall be in the field
And they answering say to him
