Seeing that many did take in hand to set in order a narration of the matters that have been fully assured among us
as they did deliver to us
it seemed good also to me
that thou mayest know the certainty of the things wherein thou wast instructed."
There was in the days of Herod
and they were both righteous before God
and they had no child
And it came to pass
according to the custom of the priesthood
and all the multitude of the people were praying without
And there appeared to him a messenger of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of the perfume
and Zacharias
and the messenger said unto him
and there shall be joy to thee
for he shall be great before the Lord
and many of the sons of Israel he shall turn to the Lord their God
and he shall go before Him
And Zacharias said unto the messenger
And the messenger answering said to him
and lo
And the people were waiting for Zacharias
and having come out
And it came to pass
and after those days
`Thus hath the Lord done to me
And in the sixth month was the messenger Gabriel sent by God
to a virgin
And the messenger having come in unto her
and she
And the messenger said to her
and lo
he shall be great
and he shall reign over the house of Jacob to the ages; and of his reign there shall be no end.'"
And Mary said unto the messenger
And the messenger answering said to her
and lo
because nothing shall be impossible with God.'"
And Mary said
And Mary having arisen in those days
and entered into the house of Zacharias
And it came to pass
and spake out with a loud voice
and whence `is' this to me
for
and happy `is' she who did believe
And Mary said
And my spirit was glad on God my Saviour
Because He looked on the lowliness of His maid-servant
For He who is mighty did to me great things
And His kindness `is' to generations of generations
He did powerfully with His arm
He brought down the mighty from thrones
The hungry He did fill with good
He received again Israel His servant
As He spake unto our fathers
And Mary remained with her about three months
And to Elisabeth was the time fulfilled for her bringing forth
and the neighbours and her kindred heard that the Lord was making His kindness great with her
And it came to pass
and his mother answering said
And they said unto her -- `There is none among thy kindred who is called by this name
and they were making signs to his father
and having asked for a tablet
and his mouth was opened presently
And fear came upon all those dwelling around them
and all who heard did lay them up in their hearts
And Zacharias his father was filled with the Holy Spirit
`Blessed `is' the Lord
And did raise an horn of salvation to us
As He spake by the mouth of His holy prophets
Salvation from our enemies
To do kindness with our fathers
An oath that He sware to Abraham our father
To give to us
To serve Him
And thou
To give knowledge of salvation to His people In remission of their sins
Through the tender mercies of our God
To give light to those sitting in darkness and death-shade
And the child grew
