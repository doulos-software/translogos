And on the first of the sabbaths
and they found the stone having been rolled away from the tomb
and having gone in
And it came to pass
and on their having become afraid
he is not here
saying -- It behoveth the Son of Man to be delivered up to the hands of sinful men
And they remembered his sayings
and having turned back from the tomb told all these things to the eleven
And it was the Magdalene Mary
and their sayings appeared before them as idle talk
And Peter having risen
And
and they were conversing with one another about all these things that have happened."
And it came to pass in their conversing and reasoning together

and he said unto them
And the one
And he said to them
how also the chief priests and our rulers did deliver him up to a judgment of death
and we were hoping that he it is who is about to redeem Israel
`And certain women of ours also astonished us
and not having found his body
and certain of those with us went away unto the tomb
And he said unto them
Was it not behoving the Christ these things to suffer
and having begun from Moses
And they came nigh to the village whither they were going
and they constrained him
And it came to pass
and their eyes were opened
And they said one to another

and they were telling the things in the way
and as they are speaking these things
and being amazed
And he said to them
see my hands and my feet
And having said this
and while they are not believing from the joy
and they gave to him part of a broiled fish
and having taken
and he said to them
Then opened he up their understanding to understand the Writings
and he said to them -- `Thus it hath been written
and reformation and remission of sins to be proclaimed in his name to all the nations
and ye -- ye are witnesses of these things."
`And
And he led them forth without -- unto Bethany
and it came to pass
and they
and were continually in the temple
