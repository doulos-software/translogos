And it came to pass thereafter
and certain women
and Joanna wife of Chuza
And a great multitude having gathered
`The sower went forth to sow his seed
`And other fell upon the rock
`And other fell amidst the thorns
`And other fell upon the good ground
And his disciples were questioning him
And he said
`And this is the simile: The seed is the word of God

and it was told him
and he answering said unto them

and having seen Jesus

And Jesus questioned him
and he was calling on him
and there was there a herd of many swine feeding in the mountain
and the demons having gone forth from the man
And those feeding `them'
and they came forth to see what was come to pass
and those also having seen `it'
And the whole multitude of the region of the Gadarenes round about asked him to go away from them
And the man from whom the demons had gone forth was beseeching of him to be with him
`Turn back to thy house
And it came to pass
and lo

and a woman
having come near behind

And having come to the house
and they were all weeping
and they were deriding him
and he having put all forth without
and her spirit came back
and her parents were amazed
