And having looked up
and he saw also a certain poor widow casting there two mites
and he said
for all these out of their superabundance did cast into the gifts to God
And certain saying about the temple
`These things that ye behold -- days will come
And they questioned him
And he said
and when ye may hear of wars and uprisings
Then said he to them
great shakings also in every place
and before all these
and it shall become to you for a testimony."
`Settle
for I will give to you a mouth and wisdom that all your opposers shall not be able to refute or resist."
`And ye shall be delivered up also by parents
and ye shall be hated by all because of my name --"
and a hair out of your head shall not perish;"
in your patience possess ye your souls."
`And when ye may see Jerusalem surrounded by encampments
then those in Judea
because these are days of vengeance
`And wo to those with child
and they shall fall by the mouth of the sword
`And there shall be signs in sun
men fainting at heart from fear
`And then they shall see the Son of Man
and these things beginning to happen bend yourselves back
And he spake a simile to them: `See the fig-tree
when they may now cast forth
so also ye
verily I say to you -- This generation may not pass away till all may have come to pass;"
the heaven and the earth shall pass away
`And take heed to yourselves
for as a snare it shall come on all those dwelling on the face of all the land
watch ye
And he was during the days in the temple teaching
and all the people were coming early unto him in the temple to hear him."
