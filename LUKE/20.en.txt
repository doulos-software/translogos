And it came to pass
and spake unto him
And he answering said unto them
the baptism of John
And they reasoned with themselves
and if we may say
And they answered
and Jesus said to them
And he began to speak unto the people this simile: `A certain man planted a vineyard
and at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant
`And he added to send another servant
and he added to send a third
`And the owner of the vineyard said
and having seen him
and having cast him outside of the vineyard
He will come
and he
every one who hath fallen on that stone shall be broken
And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him in that hour
And
and they questioned him
Is it lawful to us to give tribute to Caesar or not?'"
And he
shew me a denary; of whom hath it an image and superscription?' and they answering said
and he said to them
and they were not able to take hold on his saying before the people
And certain of the Sadducees
saying
`There were
and the second took the wife
and the third took her
and last of all died also the woman:"
in the rising again
And Jesus answering said to them
but those accounted worthy to obtain that age
for neither are they able to die any more -- for they are like messengers -- and they are sons of God
`And that the dead are raised
and He is not a God of dead men
And certain of the scribes answering said
and no more durst they question him anything."
And he said unto them
and David himself saith in the Book of Psalms
till I shall make thine enemies thy footstool;"
David
And
`Take heed of the scribes
who devour the houses of the widows
