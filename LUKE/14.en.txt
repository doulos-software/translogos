And it came to pass
and lo
and Jesus answering spake to the lawyers and Pharisees
and they were silent
and answering them he said
and they were not able to answer him again unto these things."
And he spake a simile unto those called
`When thou mayest be called by any one to marriage-feasts
and he who did call thee and him having come shall say to thee
`But
because every one who is exalting himself shall be humbled
And he said also to him who did call him
but when thou mayest make a feast
and happy thou shalt be
And one of those reclining with him
and he said to him
and he sent his servant at the hour of the supper to say to those having been called
`And they began with one consent all to excuse themselves: The first said to him
`And another said
and another said
`And that servant having come
`And the servant said
`And the lord said unto the servant
for I say to you
And there were going on with him great multitudes
`If any one doth come unto me
and whoever doth not bear his cross
`For who of you
lest that he having laid a foundation
saying -- This man began to build
`Or what king going on to engage with another king in war
and if not so -- he being yet a long way off -- having sent an embassy
`So
`The salt `is' good
neither for land nor for manure is it fit -- they cast it without. He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear.'"
