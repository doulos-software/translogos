And when he completed all his sayings in the ears of the people
and a certain centurion's servant being ill
and having heard about Jesus
And they
for he doth love our nation
And Jesus was going on with them
wherefore not even myself thought I worthy to come unto thee
for I also am a man placed under authority
And having heard these things Jesus wondered at him
and those sent
And it came to pass
and as he came nigh to the gate of the city
And the Lord having seen her
and having come near
and the dead sat up
and fear took hold of all
And the account of this went forth in all Judea about him
And the disciples of John told him about all these things
and John having called near a certain two of his disciples
And having come near to him
And in that hour he cured many from sicknesses
And Jesus answering said to them
and happy is he whoever may not be stumbled in me.'"
And the messengers of John having gone away
but what have ye gone forth to see? a man in soft garments clothed? lo
`But what have ye gone forth to see? a prophet? Yes
this is he concerning whom it hath been written
for I say to you
And all the people having heard
but the Pharisees
And the Lord said
they are like to children
`For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine
the Son of Man came eating and drinking
and the wisdom was justified from all her children.'"
And a certain one of the Pharisees was asking him that he might eat with him
and lo
and having stood behind
And the Pharisee who did call him
And Jesus answering said unto him
`Two debtors were to a certain creditor; the one was owing five hundred denaries
and they not having `wherewith' to give back
And Simon answering said
And having turned unto the woman
a kiss to me thou didst not give
with oil my head thou didst not anoint
therefore I say to thee
And he said to her
and those reclining with him (at meat) began to say within themselves
and he said unto the woman
