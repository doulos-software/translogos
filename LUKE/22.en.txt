And the feast of the unleavened food was coming nigh
and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they may take him up
And the Adversary entered into Judas
and he
and they rejoiced
and he agreed
And the day of the unleavened food came
and he sent Peter and John
and they said to him
And he said to them
and ye shall say to the master of the house
and he shall show you a large upper room furnished
and they
And when the hour come
and he said unto them
for I say to you
And having taken a cup
for I say to you that I may not drink of the produce of the vine till the reign of God may come.'"
And having taken bread
In like manner
`But
and indeed the Son of Man doth go according to what hath been determined; but wo to that man through whom he is being delivered up.'"
And they began to reason among themselves
And there happened also a strife among them -- who of them is accounted to be greater."
And he said to them
but ye `are' not so
for who is greater? he who is reclining (at meat)
`And ye -- ye are those who have remained with me in my temptations
and I appoint to you
that ye may eat and may drink at my table

and I besought for thee
And he said to him
and he said
And he said to them
Then said he to them
for I say to you
And they said
And having gone forth
and having come to the place
And he was withdrawn from them
saying
And there appeared to him a messenger from heaven strengthening him;"
and having been in agony
And having risen up from the prayer
and he said to them
And while he is speaking
and Jesus said to him
And those about him
And a certain one of them smote the servant of the chief priest
and Jesus answering said
And Jesus said to those having come upon him -- chief priests
while daily I was with you in the temple
And having taken him
and they having kindled a fire in the midst of the court
and a certain maid having seen him sitting at the light
and he disowned him
And after a little
And one hour
and Peter said
And the Lord having turned did look on Peter
and Peter having gone without
And the men who were holding Jesus were mocking him
and having blindfolded him
and many other things
And when it became day there was gathered together the eldership of the people
saying
and if I also question `you'
henceforth
And they all said
and they said
