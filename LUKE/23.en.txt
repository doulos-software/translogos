and began to accuse him
And Pilate questioned him
And Pilate said unto the chief priests
and they were the more urgent
And Pilate having heard of Galilee
and having known that he is from the jurisdiction of Herod
And Herod having seen Jesus did rejoice exceedingly
and was questioning him in many words
And the chief priests and the scribes stood vehemently accusing him
and Herod with his soldiers having set him at nought
and both Pilate and Herod became friends on that day with one another
And Pilate having called together the chief priests
said unto them

Pilate again then -- wishing to release Jesus -- called to them
but they were calling out
And he a third time said unto them

and Pilate gave judgment for their request being done
and he released him who because of sedition and murder hath been cast into the prison
And as they led him away
And there was following him a great multitude of the people
and Jesus having turned unto them
for

and when they came to the place that is called Skull

And the people were standing
And mocking him also were the soldiers
and saying
And there was also a superscription written over him
And one of the evil-doers who were hanged

and Jesus said to him
And it was
and the sun was darkened
and having cried with a loud voice
And the centurion having seen what was done
and all the multitudes who were come together to this sight
and all his acquaintances stood afar off
And lo
-- he was not consenting to their counsel and deed -- from Arimathea
he
and having taken it down
And the day was a preparation
and the women also who have come with him out of Galilee having followed after
and having turned back
