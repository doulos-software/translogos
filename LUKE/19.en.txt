And having entered
and lo
and he was seeking to see Jesus
and having run forward before
And as Jesus came up to the place
and he having hastened did come down
and having seen `it'
And Zaccheus having stood
And Jesus said unto him -- `To-day salvation did come to this house
for the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.'"
And while they are hearing these things
He said therefore
and having called ten servants of his own
and his citizens were hating him
`And it came to pass
`And the first came near
and he said to him
`And the second came
and he said also to this one
`And another came
for I was afraid of thee
`And he saith to him
and wherefore didst thou not give my money to the bank
`And to those standing by he said
(and they said to him
for I say to you
but those my enemies
And having said these things
And it came to pass
having said
and if any one doth question you
And those sent
and while they are loosing the colt
and they said
and they brought it unto Jesus
And as he is going
and as he is coming nigh now
saying
And certain of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him
and he answering said to them
And when he came nigh
saying -- `If thou didst know
`Because days shall come upon thee
and lay thee low
And having entered into the temple
saying to them
And he was teaching daily in the temple
and they were not finding what they shall do
