And in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar -- Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea
Annas and Caiaphas being chief priests -- there came a word of God unto John the son of Zacharias
and he came to all the region round the Jordan
as it hath been written in the scroll of the words of Isaiah the prophet
every valley shall be filled
and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.'"
Then said he to the multitudes coming forth to be baptised by him
make
and already also the axe unto the root of the trees is laid
And the multitudes were questioning him
and he answering saith to them
And there came also tax-gatherers to be baptised
and he said unto them
And questioning him also were those warring
And the people are looking forward
John answered
whose winnowing shovel `is' in his hand
And
and Herod the tetrarch
added also this to all
And it came to pass
and the Holy Spirit came down in a bodily appearance
And Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years of age
the `son' of Eli
the `son' of Mattathias
the `son' of Naggai
the `son' of Joanna
the `son' of Neri
the `son' of Jose
the `son' of Levi
the `son' of Melea
the `son' of David
the `son' of Amminadab
the `son' of Judah
the `son' of Serug
the `son' of Salah
the `son' of Methuselah
the `son' of Cainan
