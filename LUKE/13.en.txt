And there were present certain at that time
and Jesus answering said to them
No -- I say to you
`Or those eighteen
No -- I say to you
And he spake this simile: `A certain one had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard
and he said unto the vine-dresser
`And he answering saith to him
and if indeed it may bear fruit --; and if not so
And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath
and lo
and Jesus having seen her
and he laid on her `his' hands
And the chief of the synagogue answering -- much displeased that on the sabbath Jesus healed -- said to the multitude
Then the Lord answered him and said
and this one
And he saying these things
And he said
It is like to a grain of mustard
And again he said
It is like leaven
And he was going through cities and villages
and a certain one said to him
`Be striving to go in through the straight gate
from the time the master of the house may have risen up
then ye may begin to say
and he shall say
`There shall be there the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth
and they shall come from east and west
and lo
On that day there came near certain Pharisees
and he said to them
but it behoveth me to-day
`Jerusalem
`Lo
