And Jesus
forty days being tempted by the Devil
and the Devil said to him
And Jesus answered him
And the Devil having brought him up to an high mountain
and the Devil said to him
thou
And Jesus answering him said
And he brought him to Jerusalem
for it hath been written -- To His messengers He will give charge concerning thee
and -- On hands they shall bear thee up
And Jesus answering said to him -- `It hath been said
And having ended all temptation
And Jesus turned back in the power of the Spirit to Galilee
and he was teaching in their synagogues
And he came to Nazareth
and there was given over to him a roll of Isaiah the prophet
`The Spirit of the Lord `is' upon me
To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.'"
And having folded the roll
And he began to say unto them -- `To-day hath this writing been fulfilled in your ears;'"
and all were bearing testimony to him
And he said unto them
and he said
and of a truth I say to you
and unto none of them was Elijah sent
and many lepers were in the time of Elisha the prophet
And all in the synagogue were filled with wrath
and having risen
and he
And he came down to Capernaum
and they were astonished at his teaching
And in the synagogue was a man
saying
And Jesus did rebuke him
and amazement came upon all
and there was going forth a fame concerning him to every place of the region round about."
And having risen out of the synagogue
and having stood over her
And at the setting of the sun
And demons also were coming forth from many
And day having come
and he said unto them -- `Also to the other cities it behoveth me to proclaim good news of the reign of God
and he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee."
