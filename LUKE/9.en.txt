And having called together his twelve disciples
and he sent them to proclaim the reign of God
And he said unto them
and into whatever house ye may enter
and as many as may not receive you
And going forth they were going through the several villages
And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things being done by him
and by certain
and Herod said
And the apostles having turned back
and the multitudes having known did follow him
And the day began to decline
And he said unto them
for they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples
and they did so
and having taken the five loaves
and they did eat
And it came to pass
And they answering said
and he said to them
And having charged them
saying -- `It behoveth the Son of Man to suffer many things
And he said unto all
for whoever may will to save his life
for what is a man profited
`For whoever may be ashamed of me
and I say to you
And it came to pass
and it came to pass
And lo
who having appeared in glory
but Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep
And it came to pass
and as he was speaking these things
and a voice came out of the cloud saying
and when the voice was past
And it came to pass on the next day
and lo
and lo
and I besought thy disciples that they might cast it out
And Jesus answering said
and as he is yet coming near
And they were all amazed at the greatness of God
`Lay ye to your ears these words
And they were not knowing this saying
And there entered a reasoning among them
and Jesus having seen the reasoning of their heart
and said to them
And John answering said
and Jesus said unto him
And it came to pass
and he sent messengers before his face
and they did not receive him
And his disciples James and John having seen
and having turned
for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives
And it came to pass
and Jesus said to him
And he said unto another
and Jesus said to him
And another also said
and Jesus said unto him
