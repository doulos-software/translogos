And Shechaniah son of Jehiel

And Ezra riseth
And Ezra riseth from before the house of God

and every one who cometh not in by the third day
And gathered are all the men of Judah and Benjamin to Jerusalem by the third day
And Ezra the priest riseth
and
And all the assembly answer and say `with' a great voice
but the people `are' many
`Let
Only Jonathan son of Asahel
And the sons of the removal do so
and they finish with all the men who have settled strange women unto the first day of the first month."
