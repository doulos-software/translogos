And the seventh month cometh
And rise doth Jeshua son of Jozadak
And they establish the altar on its bases
And they make the feast of the booths as it is written
and after this a continual burnt-offering
From the first day of the seventh month they have begun to cause burnt-offerings to ascend to Jehovah
and they give money to hewers and to artificers
And in the second year of their coming in unto the house of God
And Jeshua standeth
And those building have founded the temple of Jehovah
And they respond in praising and in giving thanks to Jehovah
And many of the priests
and the people are not discerning the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people
