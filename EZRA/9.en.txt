And at the completion of these things
for they have taken of their daughters to them
And at my hearing this word
and unto me are gathered every one trembling at the words of the God of Israel
And at the present of the evening I have risen from mine affliction
and say
`From the days of our fathers we `are' in great guilt unto this day
`And now
for servants we `are'
`And now
that Thou hast commanded by the hands of thy servants the prophets
and now
`And after all that hath come upon us for our evil works
do we turn back to break Thy commands
`O Jehovah
