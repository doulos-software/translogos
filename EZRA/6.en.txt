Then Darius the king made a decree
and there hath been found at Achmetha
`In the first year of Cyrus the king
three rows of rolled stones
`And also
`Now
let alone the work of this house of God
`And by me is made a decree concerning that which ye do with the elders of these Jews to build this house of God
and what they are needing -- both young bullocks
that they be bringing near sweet savours to the God of heaven
`And by me is made a decree
And God
Then Tatnai
and the elders of the Jews are building and prospering through the prophecy of Haggai the prophet
And this house hath gone out till the third day of the month Adar
And the sons of Israel have made
and have brought near for the dedication of this house of God
and they have established the priests in their divisions
And the sons of the captivity make the passover on the fourteenth of the first month
for the priests and the Levites have been purified together -- all of them `are' pure -- and they slaughter the passover for all the sons of the captivity
And the sons of Israel
and they make the feast of unleavened things seven days with joy
