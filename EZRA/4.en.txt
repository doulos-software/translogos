And adversaries of Judah and Benjamin hear that the sons of the captivity are building a temple to Jehovah
and they draw nigh unto Zerubbabel
And Zerubbabel saith to them
And it cometh to pass
and are hiring against them counsellors to make void their counsel all the days of Cyrus king of Persia
And in the reign of Ahasuerus
and in the days of Artaxerxes have Bishlam
Rehum counsellor
Then Rehum counsellor
and the rest of the nations that the great and honourable Asnapper removed and set in the city of Samaria
This `is' a copy of a letter that they have sent unto him
Be it known to the king
`Now
Now
so that he doth seek in the book of the records of thy fathers
We are making known to the king that
An answer hath the king sent unto Rehum counsellor
The letter that ye sent unto us
and by me a decree hath been made
and mighty kings have been over Jerusalem
`Now
And beware ye of negligence in doing this; why doth the hurt become great to the loss of the kings?'"
Then from the time that a copy of the letter of king Artaxerxes is read before Rehum
then ceased the service of the house of God that `is' in Jerusalem
