And these `are' heads of their fathers
From the sons of Phinehas: Gershom; from the sons of Ithamar: Daniel; from the sons of David: Hattush;"
from the sons of Shechaniah
From the sons of Pahath-Moab: Elihoenai son of Zerahiah
From the sons of Shechaniah: the son of Jahaziel
And from the sons of Adin: Ebed son of Jonathan
And from the sons of Elam: Jeshaiah son of Athaliah
And from the sons of Shephatiah: Zebadiah son of Michael
From the sons of Joab: Obadiah son of Jehiel
And from the sons of Shelomith
And from the sons of Bebai: Zechariah son of Bebai
And from the sons of Azgad: Johanan son of Hakkatan
And from the younger sons of Adonikam -- and these `are' their names -- Eliphelet
And from the sons of Bigvai
And I gather them unto the river that is going unto Ahava
and I send for Eliezer
and I charge them for Iddo the head
And they bring to us
and Hashabiah
and from the Nethinim
And I proclaim there a fast
for I was ashamed to ask from the king a force and horsemen to help us because of the enemy in the way
And we fast
And I separate from the heads of the priests
and I weigh to them the silver
and I weigh to their hand
and basins of gold twenty
And I say unto them
watch
And the priests and the Levites took the weight of the silver
And we journey from the river Ahava
and we come in to Jerusalem
And on the fourth day hath been weighed the silver
by number
Those coming in of the captives -- sons of the removal -- have brought near burnt-offerings to the God of Israel
and they give the laws of the king to the lieutenants of the king and the governors beyond the river
