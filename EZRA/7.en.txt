And after these things
son of Shallum
son of Amariah
son of Zerahiah
son of Abishua
Ezra himself hath come up from Babylon
And there go up of the sons of Israel
And he cometh in to Jerusalem in the fifth month
for on the first of the month he hath founded the ascent from Babylon
for Ezra hath prepared his heart to seek the law of Jehovah
And this `is' a copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest
`Artaxerxes
By me hath been made a decree that every one who is willing
because that from the king and his seven counsellors thou art sent
and to carry silver and gold that the king and his counsellors willingly offered to the God of Israel
and all the silver and gold that thou findest in all the province of Babylon
therefore thou dost speedily buy with this money
and that which to thee and to thy brethren is good to do with the rest of the silver and gold
`And the vessels that are given to thee
and the rest of the needful things of the house of thy God
`And by me -- I Artaxerxes the king -- is made a decree to all treasurers who `are' beyond the river
Unto silver a hundred talents
all that `is' by the decree of the God of heaven
`And to you we are making known
`And thou
and any who doth not do the law of thy God
Blessed `is' Jehovah
and unto me hath stretched out kindness before the king and his counsellors
