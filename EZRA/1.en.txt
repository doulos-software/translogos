And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia
`Thus said Cyrus king of Persia
who `is' among you of all His people? His God is with him
`And every one who is left
And heads of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin rise
and all those round about them have strengthened `them' with their hands
And the king Cyrus hath brought out the vessels of the house of Jehovah that Nebuchadnezzar hath brought out of Jerusalem
yea
And this `is' their number: dishes of gold thirty
basins of gold thirty
All the vessels of gold and of silver `are' five thousand and four hundred; the whole hath Sheshbazzar brought up with the going up of the removal from Babylon to Jerusalem."
