And when our sailing to Italy was determined
and having embarked in a ship of Adramyttium
on the next `day' also we touched at Sidon
And thence
and having sailed over the sea over-against Cilicia and Pamphylia
and there the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria
and having sailed slowly many days
and hardly passing it
And much time being spent
saying to them
but the centurion to the pilot and to the shipowner gave credence more than to the things spoken by Paul;"
and the haven being incommodious to winter in
and a south wind blowing softly
and not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind
and the ship being caught
and having run under a certain little isle
which having taken up
And we
and on the third `day' with our own hands the tackling of the ship we cast out
and neither sun nor stars appearing for more days
And there having been long fasting
and now I exhort you to be of good cheer
for there stood by me this night a messenger of God -- whose I am
saying
wherefore be of good cheer
and on a certain island it behoveth us to be cast.'"
And when the fourteenth night came -- we being borne up and down in the Adria -- toward the middle of the night the sailors were supposing that some country drew nigh to them;"
and having sounded they found twenty fathoms
and fearing lest on rough places we may fall
And the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship
Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers
then the soldiers did cut off the ropes of the boat
And till the day was about to be
wherefore I call upon you to take nourishment
and having said these things
and all having become of good cheer
(and we were -- all the souls in the ship -- two hundred
and having eaten sufficient nourishment
And when the day came
and the anchors having taken up
and having fallen into a place of two seas
And the soldiers' counsel was that they should kill the prisoners
but the centurion
and the rest
