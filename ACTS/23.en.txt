And Paul having earnestly beheld the sanhedrim
and the chief priest Ananias commanded those standing by him to smite him on the mouth
then Paul said unto him
And those who stood by said
and Paul said
and Paul having known that the one part are Sadducees
And he having spoken this
for Sadducees
And there came a great cry
and a great dissension having come
And on the following night
And day having come
and they were more than forty who made this conspiracy by oath
who having come near to the chief priests and to the elders said
now
And the son of Paul's sister having heard of the lying in wait
and Paul having called near one of the centurions
He indeed
And the chief captain having taken him by the hand
and he said -- `The Jews agreed to request thee
thou
The chief captain
and having called near a certain two of the centurions
beasts also provide
he having written a letter after this description:"
`Claudius Lysias
This man having been taken by the Jews
and
whom I found accused concerning questions of their law
and a plot having been intimated to me against this man -- about to be of the Jews -- at once I sent unto thee
Then
and on the morrow
those having entered into Caesarea
And the governor having read `it'
`I will hear thee -- said he -- when thine accusers also may have come;' he also commanded him to be kept in the praetorium of Herod."
