And there was a certain man in Cesarea
pious
he saw in a vision manifestly
and he having looked earnestly on him
and now send men to Joppa
this one doth lodge with a certain Simon a tanner
And when the messenger who is speaking to Cornelius went away
and having declared to them all things
And on the morrow
and he became very hungry
and he doth behold the heaven opened
in which were all the four-footed beasts of the earth
and there came a voice unto him: `Having risen
And Peter said
and `there is' a voice again a second time unto him: `What God did cleanse
and this was done thrice
And as Peter was perplexed in himself what the vision that he saw might be
and having called
And Peter thinking about the vision
but having risen
and Peter having come down unto the men who have been sent from Cornelius unto him
And they said
Having called them in
and on the morrow they did enter into Cesarea; and Cornelius was waiting for them
and as it came that Peter entered in
and Peter raised him
and talking with him he went in
And he said unto them
therefore also without gainsaying I came
And Cornelius said
and he said
send
at once
And Peter having opened his mouth
but in every nation he who is fearing Him
the word that he sent to the sons of Israel
ye -- ye have known; -- the word that came throughout all Judea
Jesus who `is' from Nazareth -- how God did anoint him with the Holy Spirit and power; who went through
and we -- we are witnesses of all things that he did
`This one God did raise up the third day
not to all the people
and he commanded us to preach to the people
to this one do all the prophets testify
While Peter is yet speaking these sayings
and those of the circumcision believing were astonished -- as many as came with Peter -- because also upon the nations the gift of the Holy Spirit hath been poured out
for they were hearing them speaking with tongues and magnifying God."
Then answered Peter
he commanded them also to be baptized in the name of the Lord; then they besought him to remain certain days."
