And after these things
and having found a certain Jew
and because of being of the same craft
and he was reasoning in the synagogue every sabbath
And when both Silas and Timotheus came down from Macedonia
and on their resisting and speaking evil
And having departed thence
and Crispus
And the Lord said through a vision in the night to Paul
because I am with thee
and he continued a year and six months
And Gallio being proconsul of Achaia
saying -- `Against the law this one doth persuade men to worship God;'"
and Paul being about to open `his' mouth
but if it is a question concerning words and names
and he drave them from the tribunal;"
and all the Greeks having taken Sosthenes
And Paul having remained yet a good many days
and he came down to Ephesus
and they having requested `him' to remain a longer time with them
but took leave of them
and having come down to Cesarea
And having made some stay he went forth
And a certain Jew
this one was instructed in the way of the Lord
this one also began to speak boldly in the synagogue
and he being minded to go through into Achaia
for powerfully the Jews he was refuting publicly
