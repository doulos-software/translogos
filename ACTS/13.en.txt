These
and having come unto Salamis
and having gone through the island unto Paphos
who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus
and there withstood them Elymas the magian -- for so is his name interpreted -- seeking to pervert the proconsul from the faith."
And Saul -- who also `is' Paul -- having been filled with the Holy Spirit
said
and now
then the proconsul having seen what hath come to pass

and they having gone through from Perga
and after the reading of the law and of the prophets

and from all things from which ye were not able in the law of Moses to be declared righteous

and the synagogue having been dismissed

and the Jews having seen the multitudes

for so hath the Lord commanded us: I have set thee for a light of nations -- for thy being for salvation unto the end of the earth.'"
And the nations hearing were glad
and the word of the Lord was spread abroad through all the region."
And the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women
and they having shaken off the dust of their feet against them
and the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit."
