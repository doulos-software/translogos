And in these days
and the twelve
look out
and we to prayer
And the thing was pleasing before all the multitude
whom they did set before the apostles
And the word of God did increase
And Stephen
and there arose certain of those of the synagogue
and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking;"
then they suborned men
They did stir up also the people
they set up also false witnesses
for we have heard him saying
and gazing at him
