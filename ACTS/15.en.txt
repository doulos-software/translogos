And certain having come down from Judea
there having been
they indeed
And having come to Jerusalem
and there rose up certain of those of the sect of the Pharisees who believed
And there were gathered together the apostles and the elders
and there having been much disputing
and the heart-knowing God did bare them testimony
and did put no difference also between us and them
now
but
And all the multitude did keep silence
and after they are silent
Simeon did declare how at first God did look after to take out of the nations a people for His name
and to this agree the words of the prophets
After these things I will turn back
that the residue of men may seek after the Lord
`Known from the ages to God are all His works;"
wherefore I judge: not to trouble those who from the nations do turn back to God
but to write to them to abstain from the pollutions of the idols
for Moses from former generations in every city hath those preaching him -- in the synagogues every sabbath being read.'"
Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders
having written through their hand thus: `The apostles
seeing we have heard that certain having gone forth from us did trouble you with words
it seemed good to us
men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ --"
we have sent
`For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit
to abstain from things offered to idols
They then
and they having read
Judas also and Silas
and having passed some time
and it seemed good to Silas to remain there still."
And Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch
and after certain days
And Barnabas counseled to take with `them' John called Mark
and Paul was not thinking it good to take him with them who withdrew from them from Pamphylia
there came
and Paul having chosen Silas
and he went through Syria and Cilicia
