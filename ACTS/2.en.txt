And in the day of the Pentecost being fulfilled
and there came suddenly out of the heaven a sound as of a bearing violent breath
and there appeared to them divided tongues
and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit
And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews
and the rumour of this having come
and they were all amazed
and how do we hear
Parthians
Phrygia also
Cretes and Arabians
And they were all amazed
and others mocking said
and Peter having stood up with the eleven
for these are not drunken
`But this is that which hath been spoken through the prophet Joel:"
And it shall be in the last days
and also upon My men-servants
and I will give wonders in the heaven above
the sun shall be turned to darkness
and it shall be
`Men
this one
whom God did raise up
for David saith in regard to him: I foresaw the Lord always before me -- because He is on my right hand -- that I may not be moved;"
because of this was my heart cheered
because Thou wilt not leave my soul to hades
Thou didst make known to me ways of life
`Men
a prophet
having foreseen
`This Jesus did God raise up
at the right hand then of God having been exalted -- also the promise of the Holy Spirit having received from the Father -- he was shedding forth this
for David did not go up to the heavens
till I make thy foes thy footstool;"
assuredly
And having heard
and Peter said unto them
for to you is the promise
Also with many more other words he was testifying and exhorting
then those
and they were continuing stedfastly in the teaching of the apostles
And fear came on every soul
and all those believing were at the same place
and the possessions and the goods they were selling
Daily also continuing with one accord in the temple
praising God
