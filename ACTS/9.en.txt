And Saul
did ask from him letters to Damascus
And in the going
and having fallen upon the earth
And he said
trembling also
And the men who are journeying with him stood speechless
and Saul arose from the earth
and he was three days without seeing
And there was a certain disciple in Damascus
and the Lord `saith' unto him
and he saw in a vision a man
And Ananias answered
and here he hath authority from the chief priests
And the Lord said unto him
for I will shew him how many things it behoveth him for My name to suffer.'"
And Ananias went away
And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales
and having received nourishment
and immediately in the synagogues he was preaching the Christ
And all those hearing were amazed
And Saul was still more strengthened
And when many days were fulfilled
and their counsel against `him' was known to Saul; they were also watching the gates both day and night
and the disciples having taken him
And Saul
and Barnabas having taken him
And he was with them
and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus
and the brethren having known
Then
And it came to pass that Peter passing throughout all `quarters'
and he found there a certain man
and Peter said to him
and all those dwelling at Lydda
And in Joppa there was a certain female disciple
and it came to pass in those days she
and Lydda being nigh to Joppa
And Peter having risen
And Peter having put them all forth without
and having given her `his' hand
and it became known throughout all Joppa
and it came to pass
