And the chief priest said
and he said
and He said to him
`Then having come forth out of the land of the Chaldeans
and He gave him no inheritance in it
`And God spake thus
and the nation whom they shall serve I will judge
`And He gave to him a covenant of circumcision
and the patriarchs
and did deliver him out of all his tribulations
`And there came a dearth upon all the land of Egypt and Canaan
and Jacob having heard that there was corn in Egypt
and at the second time was Joseph made known to his brethren
and Joseph having sent
and Jacob went down to Egypt
and they were carried over into Sychem

in which time Moses was born
and he having been exposed

`The tabernacle of the testimony was among our fathers in the wilderness
which also our fathers having in succession received

`Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and in ears! ye do always the Holy Spirit resist; as your fathers -- also ye;"
which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and they killed those who declared before about the coming of the Righteous One
who received the law by arrangement of messengers
And hearing these things
and being full of the Holy Spirit
and he said

and they were stoning Stephen
and having bowed the knees
