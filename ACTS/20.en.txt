And after the ceasing of the tumult
and having gone through those parts
having made also three months' `stay' -- a counsel of the Jews having been against him -- being about to set forth to Syria
And there were accompanying him unto Asia
these
and we sailed
And on the first of the week
and there were many lamps in the upper chamber where they were gathered together
and there was sitting a certain youth
And Paul
and having come up
and they brought up the lad alive
And we having gone before unto the ship
and when he met with us at Assos
and thence having sailed
for Paul decided to sail past Ephesus
And from Miletus
and when they were come unto him
serving the Lord with all humility
how nothing I did keep back of what things are profitable
testifying fully both to Jews and Greeks
`And now
save that the Holy Spirit in every city doth testify fully
but I make account of none of these
`And now
wherefore I take you to witness this day
for I did not keep back from declaring to you all the counsel of God."
`Take heed
for I have known this
and of your own selves there shall arise men
`Therefore
and now
`The silver or gold or garments of no one did I covet;"
and ye yourselves know that to my necessities
all things I did shew you
And these things having said
and there came a great weeping to all
sorrowing most of all for the word that he had said -- that they are about no more to see his face; and they were accompanying him to the ship."
