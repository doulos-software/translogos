And about that time
and he killed James
and having seen that it is pleasing to the Jews
whom also having seized
Peter
and when Herod was about to bring him forth
and lo
The messenger also said to him
and having gone forth
and having passed through a first ward
And Peter having come to himself
also
And Peter having knocked at the door of the porch
and having known the voice of Peter
and they said unto her
and Peter was continuing knocking
and having beckoned to them with the hand to be silent
And day having come
and Herod having sought for him
And Herod was highly displeased with the Tyrians and Sidonians
and on a set day
and the populace were shouting
and presently there smote him a messenger of the Lord
And the word of God did grow and did multiply
and Barnabas and Saul did turn back out of Jerusalem
