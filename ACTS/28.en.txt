And having been saved
and the foreigners were shewing us no ordinary kindness
but Paul having gathered together a quantity of sticks
And when the foreigners saw the beast hanging from his hand
he then
and they were expecting him to be about to be inflamed
And in the neighbourhood of that place were lands of the principal man of the island
and it came to pass
this
who also with many honours did honour us
And after three months
and having landed at Syracuse
thence having gone round
where
and thence
And when we came to Rome
And it came to pass after three days
who
and the Jews having spoken against `it'
for this cause
And they said unto him
and we think it good from thee to hear what thou dost think
and having appointed him a day
and
And not being agreed with one another
saying
for made gross was the heart of this people
`Be it known
and he having said these things
and Paul remained an entire two years in his own hired `house'
preaching the reign of God
