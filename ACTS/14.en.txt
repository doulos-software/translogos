And it came to pass in Iconium
and the unbelieving Jews did stir up and made evil the souls of the nations against the brethren;"
long time
And the multitude of the city was divided
and when there was a purpose both of the nations and of the Jews with their rulers to use `them' despitefully
they having become aware
and there they were proclaiming good news."
And a certain man in Lystra
this one was hearing Paul speaking
said with a loud voice
and the multitudes having seen what Paul did
they were calling also Barnabas Zeus
And the priest of the Zeus that is before their city
and having heard
and saying
who in the past generations did suffer all the nations to go on in their ways
though
and these things saying
And there came thither
and the disciples having surrounded him
Having proclaimed good news also to that city
confirming the souls of the disciples
and having appointed to them by vote elders in every assembly
And having passed through Pisidia
and having spoken in Perga the word
and thence did sail to Antioch
and having come and gathered together the assembly
and they abode there not a little time with the disciples."
