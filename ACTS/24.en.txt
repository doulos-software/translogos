And after five days came down the chief priest Ananias
and he having been called
always
and that I may not be further tedious to thee
for having found this man a pestilence
who also the temple did try to profane
and Lysias the chief captain having come near
having commanded his accusers to come to thee
and the Jews also agreed
And Paul answered -- the governor having beckoned to him to speak -- `Knowing `that' for many years thou hast been a judge to this nation
thou being able to know that it is not more than twelve days to me since I went up to worship in Jerusalem
and neither in the temple did they find me reasoning with any one
nor are they able to prove against me the things concerning which they now accuse me."
`And I confess this to thee
having hope toward God
and in this I do exercise myself
`And after many years I came
in which certain Jews from Asia did find me purified in the temple
whom it behoveth to be present before thee
or let these same say if they found any unrighteousness in me in my standing before the sanhedrim
except concerning this one voice
And having heard these things
having given also a direction to the centurion to keep Paul
And after certain days
and he reasoning concerning righteousness
and at the same time also hoping that money shall be given to him by Paul
and two years having been fulfilled
