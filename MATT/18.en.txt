At that hour came the disciples near to Jesus
And Jesus having called near a child
and said
whoever then may humble himself as this child
`And he who may receive one such child in my name
and whoever may cause to stumble one of those little ones who are believing in me
`Wo to the world from the stumbling-blocks! for there is a necessity for the stumbling-blocks to come
`And if thy hand or thy foot doth cause thee to stumble
`And if thine eye doth cause thee to stumble
`Beware! -- ye may not despise one of these little ones
for the Son of Man did come to save the lost."
`What think ye? if a man may have an hundred sheep
and if it may come to pass that he doth find it
so it is not will in presence of your Father who is in the heavens
`And if thy brother may sin against thee
and if he may not hear
`And if he may not hear them
`Verily I say to you
`Again
for where there are two or three gathered together -- to my name
Then Peter having come near to him
Jesus saith to him
`Because of this was the reign of the heavens likened to a man
and he having begun to take account
and he having nothing to pay
The servant then
and the lord of that servant having been moved with compassion did release him
`And
His fellow-servant then
and he would not
`And his fellow-servants having seen the things that were done
then having called him
did it not behove also thee to have dealt kindly with thy fellow-servant
`And having been wroth
so also my heavenly Father will do to you
