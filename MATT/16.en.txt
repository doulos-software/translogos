And the Pharisees and Sadducees having come
and he answering said to them
and at morning
`A generation evil and adulterous doth seek a sign
And his disciples having come to the other side
and Jesus said to them
and they were reasoning in themselves
And Jesus having known
do ye not yet understand
nor the seven loaves of the four thousand
how do ye not understand that I did not speak to you of bread -- to take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?'"
Then they understood that he did not say to take heed of the leaven of the bread
And Jesus
and they said
He saith to them
and Simon Peter answering said
And Jesus answering said to him
`And I also say to thee
and I will give to thee the keys of the reign of the heavens
Then did he charge his disciples that they may say to no one that he is Jesus the Christ."
From that time began Jesus to shew to his disciples that it is necessary for him to go away to Jerusalem
And having taken him aside
and he having turned
Then said Jesus to his disciples
for whoever may will to save his life
for what is a man profited if he may gain the whole world
`For
Verily I say to you
