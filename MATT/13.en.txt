And in that day Jesus
and gathered together unto him were many multitudes
and he spake to them many things in similes
and in his sowing
and others fell upon the rocky places
and the sun having risen they were scorched
and others fell upon the thorns
and others fell upon the good ground
He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear.'"
And the disciples having come near
And he answering said to them that -- `To you it hath been given to know the secrets of the reign of the heavens
for whoever hath
`Because of this
and fulfilled on them is the prophecy of Isaiah
for made gross was the heart of this people
`And happy are your eyes because they see
for verily I say to you
`Ye
Every one hearing the word of the reign
`And that sown on the rocky places
and he hath not root in himself
`And that sown toward the thorns
`And that sown on the good ground: this is he who is hearing the word
Another simile he set before them
and
and when the herb sprang up
`And the servants of the householder
And he saith to them
`And he said
suffer both to grow together till the harvest
Another simile he set before them
which less
Another simile spake he to them: `The reign of the heavens is like to leaven
All these things spake Jesus in similes to the multitudes
that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophet
Then having let away the multitudes
And he answering said to them
and the field is the world
and the enemy who sowed them is the devil
`As
the Son of Man shall send forth his messengers
and shall cast them to the furnace of the fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth."
`Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the reign of their Father. He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear."
`Again
`Again
who having found one pearl of great price
`Again
which
so shall it be in the full end of the age
and shall cast them to the furnace of the fire
Jesus saith to them
And he said to them
And it came to pass
and having come to his own country
is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary
and his sisters -- are they not all with us? whence
and they were stumbled at him. And Jesus said to them
and he did not there many mighty works
