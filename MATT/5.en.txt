And having seen the multitudes
and having opened his mouth
`Happy the poor in spirit -- because theirs is the reign of the heavens."
`Happy the mourning -- because they shall be comforted."
`Happy the meek -- because they shall inherit the land."
`Happy those hungering and thirsting for righteousness -- because they shall be filled."
`Happy the kind -- because they shall find kindness."
`Happy the clean in heart -- because they shall see God."
`Happy the peacemakers -- because they shall be called Sons of God."
`Happy those persecuted for righteousness' sake -- because theirs is the reign of the heavens."
`Happy are ye whenever they may reproach you
rejoice ye and be glad
`Ye are the salt of the land
`Ye are the light of the world
nor do they light a lamp
so let your light shine before men
`Do not suppose that I came to throw down the law or the prophets -- I did not come to throw down
for
`Whoever therefore may loose one of these commands -- the least -- and may teach men so
`For I say to you
`Ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not kill
but I -- I say to you
`If
leave there thy gift before the altar
`Be agreeing with thy opponent quickly
verily I say to thee
`Ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not commit adultery;"
but I -- I say to you
`But
`And
`And it was said
but I -- I say to you
`Again
but I -- I say to you
nor by the earth
nor by thy head mayest thou swear
but let your word be
`Ye heard that it was said: Eye for eye
but I -- I say to you
and whoever is willing to take thee to law
`And whoever shall impress thee one mile
to him who is asking of thee be giving
`Ye heard that it was said: Thou shalt love thy neighbor
but I -- I say to you
that ye may be sons of your Father in the heavens
`For
and if ye may salute your brethren only
ye shall therefore be perfect
