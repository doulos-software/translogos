And it came to pass
and great multitudes followed him
And the Pharisees came near to him
And he answering said to them
and said
so that they are no more two
They say to him
He saith to them -- `Moses for your stiffness of heart did suffer you to put away your wives
`And I say to you
His disciples say to him
And he said to them
for there are eunuchs who from the mother's womb were so born; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who kept themselves eunuchs because of the reign of the heavens: he who is able to receive `it' -- let him receive.'"
Then were brought near to him children that he might put hands on them and pray
But Jesus said
and having laid on them `his' hands
And lo
And he said to him
He saith to him
honour thy father and mother
The young man saith to him
Jesus said to him
And the young man
and Jesus said to his disciples
and again I say to you
And his disciples having heard
And Jesus having earnestly beheld
Then Peter answering said to him
And Jesus said to them
and every one who left houses
and many first shall be last
