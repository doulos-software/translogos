And morning having come
and having bound him
Then Judas -- he who delivered him up -- having seen that he was condemned
`I did sin
and having cast down the silverlings in the sanctuary
And the chief priests having taken the silverlings
and having taken counsel
therefore was that field called
Then was fulfilled that spoken through Jeremiah the prophet
and gave them for the field of the potter
And Jesus stood before the governor
And in his being accused by the chief priests and the elders
then saith Pilate to him

And evening having come
he having gone near to Pilate
