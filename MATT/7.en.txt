`Judge not
for in what judgment ye judge
`And why dost thou behold the mote that `is' in thy brother's eye
or
Hypocrite
`Ye may not give that which is `holy' to the dogs
`Ask
for every one who is asking doth receive
`Or what man is of you
and if a fish he may ask -- a serpent will he present to him?"
if
`All things
`Go ye in through the strait gate
how strait `is' the gate
`But
From their fruits ye shall know them; do `men' gather from thorns grapes? or from thistles figs?"
so every good tree doth yield good fruits
A good tree is not able to yield evil fruits
Every tree not yielding good fruit is cut down and is cast to fire:"
therefore from their fruits ye shall know them."
`Not every one who is saying to me Lord
Many will say to me in that day
and then I will acknowledge to them
`Therefore
and the rain did descend
`And every one who is hearing of me these words
and the rain did descend
And it came to pass
for he was teaching them as having authority
