And when they came nigh to Jerusalem
saying to them
and if any one may say anything to you
And all this came to pass
`Tell ye the daughter of Zion
And the disciples having gone and having done as Jesus commanded them
brought the ass and the colt
and the very great multitude spread their own garments in the way
and the multitudes who were going before
And he having entered into Jerusalem
And the multitudes said
And Jesus entered into the temple of God
and he saith to them
And there came to him blind and lame men in the temple
and the chief priests and the scribes having seen the wonderful things that he did
and they said to him
And having left them
and in the morning turning back to the city
and having seen a certain fig-tree on the way
And the disciples having seen
And Jesus answering said to them
and all -- as much as ye may ask in the prayer
And he having come to the temple
And Jesus answering said to them
the baptism of John
and if we should say
And answering Jesus they said
`And what think ye? A man had two children
And he answering said
`And having come to the second
which of the two did the will of the father?' They say to him
for John came unto you in the way of righteousness
`Hear ye another simile: There was a certain man
`And when the season of the fruits came nigh
and the husbandmen having taken his servants
`Again he sent other servants more than the first
`And at last he sent unto them his son
and the husbandmen having seen the son
and having taken him
whenever therefore the lord of the vineyard may come
They say to him
Jesus saith to them
`Because of this I say to you
and he who is falling on this stone shall be broken
And the chief priests and the Pharisees having heard his similes
and seeking to lay hold on him
