`Then shall the reign of the heavens be likened to ten virgins
and five of them were prudent
they who were foolish having taken their lamps
and the prudent took oil in their vessels
`And the bridegroom tarrying
and in the middle of the night a cry was made
`Then rose all those virgins
and the foolish said to the prudent
and the prudent answered
`And while they are going away to buy
and afterwards come also do the rest of the virgins
and he answering said
`Watch therefore
`For -- as a man going abroad did call his own servants
and to one he gave five talents
`And he who did receive the five talents
in like manner also he who `received' the two
and he who did receive the one
`And after a long time cometh the lord of those servants
and he who did receive the five talents having come
`And his lord said to him
`And he who also did receive the two talents having come
`His lord said to him
`And he also who hath received the one talent having come
and having been afraid
`And his lord answering said to him
it behoved thee then to put my money to the money-lenders
`Take therefore from him the talent
for to every one having shall be given
and the unprofitable servant cast ye forth to the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth."
`And whenever the Son of Man may come in his glory
and gathered together before him shall be all the nations
and he shall set the sheep indeed on his right hand
`Then shall the king say to those on his right hand
for I did hunger
naked
`Then shall the righteous answer him
and when did we see thee a stranger
and when did we see thee infirm
`And the king answering
Then shall he say also to those on the left hand
for I did hunger
a stranger I was
`Then shall they answer
`Then shall he answer them
And these shall go away to punishment age-during
