Then come unto Jesus do they from Jerusalem -- scribes and Pharisees -- saying
`Wherefore do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they do not wash their hands when they may eat bread.'"
And he answering said to them
for God did command
but ye say
and he may not honour his father or his mother
`Hypocrites
This people doth draw nigh to Me with their mouth
and in vain do they worship Me
And having called near the multitude
not that which is coming into the mouth doth defile the man
Then his disciples having come near
And he answering said
let them alone
And Peter answering said to him
And Jesus said
do ye not understand that all that is going into the mouth doth pass into the belly
but the things coming forth from the mouth from the heart do come forth
for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts
these are the things defiling the man; but to eat with unwashen hands doth not defile the man.'"
And Jesus having come forth thence
and lo
And he did not answer her a word; and his disciples having come to him
and he answering said
And having come
and he answering said
And she said
then answering
And Jesus having passed thence
and there came to him great multitudes
so that the multitudes did wonder
And Jesus having called near his disciples
And his disciples say to him
And Jesus saith to them
And he commanded the multitudes to sit down upon the ground
and having taken the seven loaves and the fishes
And they did all eat
and those eating were four thousand men
And having let away the multitudes
