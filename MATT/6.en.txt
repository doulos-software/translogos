`Take heed your kindness not to do before men
whenever
`But thou
that thy kindness may be in secret
`And when thou mayest pray
`But thou
`And -- praying -- ye may not use vain repetitions like the nations
be ye not therefore like to them
thus therefore pray ye: `Our Father who `art' in the heavens! hallowed be Thy name."
`Thy reign come: Thy will come to pass
`Our appointed bread give us to-day."
`And forgive us our debts
`And mayest Thou not lead us to temptation
`For
but if ye may not forgive men their trespasses
`And when ye may fast
`But thou
that thou mayest not appear to men fasting
`Treasure not up to yourselves treasures on the earth
but treasure up to yourselves treasures in heaven
for where your treasure is
`The lamp of the body is the eye
but if thine eye may be evil
`None is able to serve two lords
`Because of this I say to you
look to the fowls of the heaven
`And who of you
and about clothing why are ye anxious? consider well the lilies of the field; how do they grow? they do not labour
and I say to you
`And if the herb of the field
therefore ye may not be anxious
for all these do the nations seek for
but seek ye first the reign of God and His righteousness
Be not therefore anxious for the morrow
