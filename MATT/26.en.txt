And it came to pass
`Ye have known that after two days the passover cometh
Then were gathered together the chief priests
and they consulted together that they might take Jesus by guile
and they said
And Jesus having been in Bethany
there came to him a woman having an alabaster box of ointment
And having seen `it'
for this ointment could have been sold for much
And Jesus having known
for the poor always ye have with you
for she having put this ointment on my body -- for my burial she did `it'."
Verily I say to you
Then one of the twelve
`What are ye willing to give me
and from that time he was seeking a convenient season to deliver him up."
And on the first `day' of the unleavened food came the disciples near to Jesus
and he said
and the disciples did as Jesus appointed them
And evening having come
and while they are eating
And being grieved exceedingly
And he answering said
the Son of Man doth indeed go
And Judas -- he who delivered him up -- answering said
And while they were eating
and having taken the cup
for this is my blood of the new covenant
and I say to you
And having sung a hymn
then saith Jesus to them
but
And Peter answering said to him
Jesus said to him
Peter saith to him
Then come with them doth Jesus to a place called Gethsemane
And having taken Peter
then saith he to them
And having gone forward a little
And he cometh unto the disciples
watch
Again
and having come
And having left them
then cometh he unto his disciples
Rise
And while he is yet speaking
And he who did deliver him up did give them a sign
and immediately
and Jesus said to him
And lo
Then saith Jesus to him
dost thou think that I am not able now to call upon my Father
how then may the Writings be fulfilled
In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes
but all this hath come to pass
And those laying hold on Jesus led `him' away unto Caiaphas the chief priest
and Peter was following him afar off
And the chief priests
and they did not find; and many false witnesses having come near
said
And the chief priest having stood up
and Jesus was silent. And the chief priest answering said to him
Jesus saith to him
Then the chief priest rent his garments
what think ye?' and they answering said
Then did they spit in his face and buffet him
saying
And Peter without was sitting in the court
And he denied before all
And he having gone forth to the porch
and again did he deny with an oath -- `I have not known the man.'"
And after a little those standing near having come
Then began he to anathematise
and Peter remembered the saying of Jesus
