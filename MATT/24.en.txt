And having gone forth
and Jesus said to them
And when he is sitting on the mount of the Olives
And Jesus answering said to them
for many shall come in my name
and ye shall begin to hear of wars
`For nation shall rise against nation
and all these `are' the beginning of sorrows;"
then they shall deliver you up to tribulation
and then shall many be stumbled
`And many false prophets shall arise
and because of the abounding of the lawlessness
but he who did endure to the end
and this good news of the reign shall be proclaimed in all the world
`Whenever
then those in Judea -- let them flee to the mounts;"
he on the house-top -- let him not come down to take up any thing out of his house;"
and he in the field -- let him not turn back to take his garments."
`And wo to those with child
and pray ye that your flight may not be in winter
for there shall be then great tribulation
And if those days were not shortened
`Then if any one may say to you
for there shall arise false Christs
Lo
`If therefore they may say to you
for as the lightning doth come forth from the east
for wherever the carcase may be
`And immediately after the tribulation of those days
and then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in the heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the earth smite the breast
and he shall send his messengers with a great sound of a trumpet
`And from the fig-tree learn ye the simile: When already its branch may have become tender
so also ye
Verily I say to you
The heaven and the earth shall pass away
`And concerning that day and the hour no one hath known -- not even the messengers of the heavens -- except my Father only;"
and as the days of Noah -- so shall be also the presence of the Son of Man;"
for as they were
and they did not know till the flood came and took all away; so shall be also the presence of the Son of Man."
Then two men shall be in the field
two women shall be grinding in the mill
`Watch ye therefore
and this know
because of this also ye
`Who
Happy that servant
verily I say to you
`And
and may begin to beat the fellow-servants
the lord of that servant will arrive in a day when he doth not expect
and will cut him off
