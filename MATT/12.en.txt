At that time did Jesus go on the sabbaths through the corn
and the Pharisees having seen
And he said to them
how he went into the house of God
`Or did ye not read in the Law
and I say to you
and if ye had known what is: Kindness I will
for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath.'"
And having departed thence
and lo
And he said to them
How much better
Then saith he to the man
And the Pharisees having gone forth
and Jesus having known
and did charge them that they might not make him manifest
that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet
`Lo
he shall not strive nor cry
a bruised reed he shall not break
and in his name shall nations hope.'"
Then was brought to him a demoniac
And all the multitudes were amazed
but the Pharisees having heard
And Jesus
and if the Adversary doth cast out the Adversary
`And if I
`But if I
`Or how is one able to go into the house of the strong man
`He who is not with me is against me
Because of this I say to you
And whoever may speak a word against the Son of Man it shall be forgiven to him
`Either make the tree good
`Brood of vipers! how are ye able to speak good things -- being evil? for out of the abundance of the heart doth the mouth speak."
The good man out of the good treasure of the heart doth put forth the good things
`And I say to you
for from thy words thou shalt be declared righteous
Then answered certain of the scribes and Pharisees
And he answering said to them
for
`Men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation
`A queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation
`And
then it saith
then doth it go
And while he was yet speaking to the multitudes
and one said to him
And he answering said to him who spake to him
And having stretched forth his hand toward his disciples
for whoever may do the will of my Father who is in the heavens
