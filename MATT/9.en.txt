And having gone to the boat
and lo
And lo
And Jesus
for which is easier? to say
`But
And he
and the multitudes having seen
And Jesus passing by thence
And it came to pass
and the Pharisees having seen
And Jesus having heard
but having gone
Then come to him do the disciples of John
And Jesus said to them
`And no one doth put a patch of undressed cloth on an old garment
`Nor do they put new wine into old skins
While he is speaking these things to them
And Jesus having risen
and lo
for she said within herself
And Jesus having turned about
And Jesus having come to the house of the ruler
he saith to them
but
and the fame of this went forth to all the land."
And Jesus passing on thence
And he having come to the house
Then touched he their eyes
and their eyes were opened
but they
And as they are coming forth
and the demon having been cast out
but the Pharisees said
And Jesus was going up and down all the cities and the villages
And having seen the multitudes
then saith he to his disciples
beseech ye therefore the Lord of the harvest
