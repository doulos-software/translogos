And having called to him his twelve disciples
And of the twelve apostles the names are these: first
Philip
Simon the Cananite
These twelve did Jesus send forth
and be going rather unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
`And
infirm ones be healing
`Provide not gold
nor scrip for the way
`And into whatever city or village ye may enter
And coming to the house salute it
and if indeed the house be worthy
`And whoever may not receive you nor hear your words
verily I say to you
`Lo
And
and before governors and kings ye shall be brought for my sake
`And whenever they may deliver you up
for ye are not the speakers
`And brother shall deliver up brother to death
and ye shall be hated by all because of my name
`And whenever they may persecute you in this city
`A disciple is not above the teacher
sufficient to the disciple that he may be as his teacher
`Ye may not
that which I tell you in the darkness
`And be not afraid of those killing the body
`Are not two sparrows sold for an assar? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father;"
and of you -- even the hairs of the head are all numbered;"
be not therefore afraid
`Every one
and whoever shall deny me before men
`Ye may not suppose that I came to put peace on the earth; I did not come to put peace
for I came to set a man at variance against his father
and the enemies of a man are those of his household."
`He who is loving father or mother above me
and whoever doth not receive his cross and follow after me
`He who found his life shall lose it
`He who is receiving you doth receive me
he who is receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet
and whoever may give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple
