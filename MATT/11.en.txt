And it came to pass
And John having heard in the prison the works of the Christ
said to him
And Jesus answering said to them
blind receive sight
and happy is he who may not be stumbled in me.'"
And as they are going
`But what went ye out to see? -- a man clothed in soft garments? lo
`But what went ye out to see? -- a prophet? yes
for this is he of whom it hath been written
Verily I say to you
`And
for all the prophets and the law till John did prophesy
and if ye are willing to receive `it'
he who is having ears to hear -- let him hear."
`And to what shall I liken this generation? it is like little children in market-places
and saying
`For John came neither eating nor drinking
the Son of Man came eating and drinking
Then began he to reproach the cities in which were done most of his mighty works
`Wo to thee
but I say to you
`And thou
but I say to you
At that time Jesus answering said
Yes
`All things were delivered to me by my Father
`Come unto me
take up my yoke upon you
for my yoke `is' easy
