Then Jesus was led up to the wilderness by the Spirit
and having fasted forty days and forty nights
And the Tempter having come to him said
But he answering said
Then doth the Devil take him to the `holy' city
and saith to him
Jesus said to him again
Again doth the Devil take him to a very high mount
and saith to him
Then saith Jesus to him
Then doth the Devil leave him
And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up
and having left Nazareth
that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet
`Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali
the people that is sitting in darkness saw a great light
From that time began Jesus to proclaim and to say
And Jesus
and he saith to them
and they
And having advanced thence
and they
And Jesus was going about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues
and his fame went forth to all Syria
And there followed him many multitudes from Galilee
