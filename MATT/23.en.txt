Then Jesus spake to the multitudes
saying
all
for they bind together burdens heavy and grievous to be borne
`And all their works they do to be seen by men
they love also the chief couches in the supper
and the salutations in the market-places
`And ye -- ye may not be called Rabbi
and ye may not call `any' your father on the earth
nor may ye be called directors
And the greater of you shall be your ministrant
and whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled
`Wo to you
`Wo to you
`Wo to you
`Wo to you
Fools and blind! for which `is' greater
`And
Fools and blind! for which `is' greater
`He therefore who did swear by the altar
and he who did swear by the sanctuary
and he who did swear by the heaven
`Wo to you
`Blind guides! who are straining out the gnat
`Wo to you
`Blind Pharisee! cleanse first the inside of the cup and the plate
`Wo to you
so also ye outwardly indeed do appear to men righteous
`Wo to you
and say
So that ye testify to yourselves
and ye -- ye fill up the measure of your fathers."
`Serpents! brood of vipers! how may ye escape from the judgment of the gehenna?"
`Because of this
that on you may come all the righteous blood being poured out on the earth from the blood of Abel the righteous
verily I say to you
`Jerusalem
Lo
for I say to you
