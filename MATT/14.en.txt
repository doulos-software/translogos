At that time did Herod the tetrarch hear the fame of Jesus
and said to his servants
For Herod having laid hold on John
for John was saying to him
and
But the birthday of Herod being kept
whereupon with an oath he professed to give her whatever she might ask."
And she having been instigated by her mother -- `Give me (says she) here upon a plate the head of John the Baptist;"
and the king was grieved
and having sent
and his head was brought upon a plate
And his disciples having come
and Jesus having heard
And Jesus having come forth
and evening having come
And Jesus said to them
And they say to him
And he said
And having commanded the multitudes to recline upon the grass
and they did all eat
and those eating were about five thousand men
And immediately Jesus constrained his disciples to go into the boat
and having let away the multitudes
and the boat was now in the midst of the sea
And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went away to them
and the disciples having seen him walking upon the sea
and immediately Jesus spake to them
And Peter answering him said
and he said
but seeing the wind vehement
And immediately Jesus
and they having gone to the boat the wind lulled
and those in the boat having come
And having passed over
and having recognized him
and were calling on him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment
