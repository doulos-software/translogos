And on the eve of the sabbaths
and lo
and his countenance was as lightning
and from the fear of him did the keepers shake
And the messenger answering said to the women
he is not here
and having gone quickly
And having gone forth quickly from the tomb
and as they were going to tell to his disciples
Then saith Jesus to them
And while they are going on
and having been gathered together with the elders
saying
and if this be heard by the governor
And they
And the eleven disciples went to Galilee
and having seen him
And having come near
having gone
teaching them to observe all
