`For the reign of the heavens is like to a man
and having agreed with the workmen for a denary a day
`And having gone forth about the third hour
and to these he said
and they went away. `Again
And about the eleventh hour
they say to him
`And evening having come
And they of about the eleventh hour having come
`And the first having come
and having received `it'
that These
`And he answering said to one of them
take that which is thine
is it not lawful to me to do what I will in mine own? is thine eye evil because I am good?"
So the last shall be first
And Jesus going up to Jerusalem
`Lo
and they shall condemn him to death
Then came near to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee
and he said to her
And Jesus answering said
And he saith to them
And the ten having heard
and Jesus having called them near
but not so shall it be among you
and whoever may will among you to be first
even as the Son of Man did not come to be ministered to
And they going forth from Jericho
and lo
And the multitude charged them that they might be silent
And having stood
they say to him
and having been moved with compassion
