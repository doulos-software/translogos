And Jesus answering
`The reign of the heavens was likened to a man
and he sent forth his servants to call those having been called to the marriage-feasts
`Again he sent forth other servants
and they
and the rest
`And the king having heard
then saith he to his servants
be going
`And those servants
`And the king having come in to view those reclining
and he saith to him
`Then said the king to the ministrants
for many are called
Then the Pharisees having gone
and they send to him their disciples with the Herodians
tell us
And Jesus having known their wickedness
show me the tribute-coin?' and they brought to him a denary;"
and he saith to them
they say to him
and having heard they wondered
In that day there came near to him Sadducees
`Teacher
`And there were with us seven brothers
in like manner also the second
and last of all died also the woman;"
therefore in the rising again
And Jesus answering said to them
for in the rising again they do not marry
`And concerning the rising again of the dead
I am the God of Abraham
And having heard
and the Pharisees
and one of them
`Teacher
And Jesus said to him
this is a first and great command;"
and the second `is' like to it
on these -- the two commands -- all the law and the prophets do hang.'"
And the Pharisees having been gathered together
saying
He saith to them
The Lord said to my lord
If then David doth call him lord
And no one was able to answer him a word
