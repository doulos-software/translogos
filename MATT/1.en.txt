A roll of the birth of Jesus Christ
Abraham begat Isaac
and Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Tamar
and Ram begat Amminadab
and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab
and Jesse begat David the king. And David the king begat Solomon
and Solomon begat Rehoboam
and Asa begat Jehoshaphat
and Uzziah begat Jotham
and Hezekiah begat Manasseh
and Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brethren
And after the Babylonian removal
and Zerubbabel begat Abiud
and Azor begat Sadok
and Eliud begat Eleazar
and Jacob begat Joseph
All the generations
And of Jesus Christ
and Joseph her husband being righteous
And on his thinking of these things
and she shall bring forth a son
And all this hath come to pass
`Lo
And Joseph
and did not know her till she brought forth her son -- the first-born
