And these `are' the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel
Amariah
Shechaniah
Iddo
Miamin
Shemaiah
Sallu
And the Levites `are' Jeshua
and Bakbukiah and Unni
And Jeshua hath begotten Joiakim
and Joiada hath begotten Jonathan
And in the days of Joiakim have been priests
of Ezra
of Melicu
of Harim
of Iddo
of Abijah
of Bilgah
and of Joiarib
of Sallai
of Hilkiah
The Levites
Sons of Levi
and heads of the Levites: Hashabiah
Mattaniah
These `are' in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua
And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places
and sons of the singers are gathered together even from the circuit round about Jerusalem
and from the house of Gilgal
and the priests and the Levites are cleansed
And I bring up the heads of Judah upon the wall
and after them goeth Hoshaiah
and Azariah
Judah
and of the sons of the priests with trumpets
and his brethren Shemaiah
and by the gate of the fountain and over-against them
And the second thanksgiving company that is going over-against
and from beyond the gate of Ephraim
And the two thanksgiving companies stand in the house of God
and the priests
and Masseiah
and they sacrifice on that day great sacrifices and rejoice
And certain are appointed on that day over the chambers for treasures
And the singers and the gatekeepers keep the charge of their God
for in the days of David and Asaph of old `were' heads of the singers
And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel
