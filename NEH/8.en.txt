And all the people are gathered as one man unto the broad place that `is' before the water-gate
And Ezra the priest bringeth the law before the assembly
and he readeth in it before the broad place that `is' before the water-gate
And Ezra the scribe standeth on a tower of wood that they made for the purpose
And Ezra openeth the book before the eyes of all the people -- for above all the people he hath been -- and at his opening `it' all the people have stood up
and Ezra blesseth Jehovah
And Jeshua
and they read in the book
And Nehemiah -- he `is' the Tirshatha -- saith (and Ezra the priest
And he saith to them
And the Levites are keeping all the people silent
And all the people go to eat
And on the second day have been gathered heads of the fathers of all the people
And they find written in the law that Jehovah commanded by the hand of Moses
and that they proclaim and cause to pass over all their cities
And the people go out
And they make -- all the assembly of the captives of the captivity -- booths
And he readeth in the book of the law of God day by day
