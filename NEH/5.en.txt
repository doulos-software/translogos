And there is a great cry of the people and their wives
yea
And there are who are saying
And there are who are saying
and now
And it is very displeasing to me when I have heard their cry and these words
and my heart reigneth over me
and say to them
And I say
And also
Give back
And they say
also
Also
the former governors who `are' before me have made themselves heavy on the people
And also
and of the Jews
and that which hath been prepared for one day `is' one ox
Remember for me
