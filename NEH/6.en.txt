And it cometh to pass
that Sanballat sendeth
And I send unto them messengers
and they send unto me
And Sanballat sendeth unto me
it is written in it
And also
And I send unto him
for all of them are making us afraid
And I have entered the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah
And I say
And I discern
so that he `is' an hireling
Be mindful
And the wall is completed in the twenty and fifth of Elul
and it cometh to pass
Also
for many in Judah are sworn to him
also
