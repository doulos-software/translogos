And the rest of the people
are laying hold on their brethren
and that we give not our daughters to the peoples of the land
and the peoples of the land who are bringing in the wares and any corn on the sabbath-day to sell
And we have appointed for ourselves commands
for bread of the arrangement
And the lots we have caused to fall for the offering of wood
and to bring in the first fruits of our ground
and the firstlings of our sons
And the beginning of our dough
and the priest
for unto the chambers do they bring in -- the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi -- the heave-offering of the corn
