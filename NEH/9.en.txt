And in the twenty and fourth day of this month have the sons of Israel been gathered
and the seed of Israel are separated from all sons of a stranger
and rise up on their station
And there stand up on the ascent
And the Levites say
Thou `art' He
`Thou `art' He
and didst find his heart stedfast before Thee
and dost see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt
and dost give signs and wonders on Pharaoh
And the sea Thou hast cleaved before them
And by a pillar of cloud Thou hast led them by day
`And on mount Sinai Thou hast come down
And Thy holy sabbath Thou hast made known to them
and bread from the heavens Thou hast given to them for their hunger
`And they and our fathers have acted proudly
yea
`Also
and Thou
`And Thy good Spirit Thou hast given
and forty years Thou hast nourished them in a wilderness; they have not lacked; their garments have not worn out
`And Thou givest to them kingdoms
And their sons Thou hast multiplied as the stars of the heavens
`And the sons come in
And they capture fenced cities
`And they are disobedient
and Thou givest them into the hand of their adversaries
`And when they have rest
and dost testify against them
`And Thou drawest over them many years
and in Thine abundant mercies Thou hast not made them a consumption
`And now
and Thou `art' righteous concerning all that hath come upon us
and our kings
and they
`Lo
and its increase it is multiplying to the kings whom Thou hast set over us in our sins; and over our bodies they are ruling
And for all this we are making a stedfast covenant
