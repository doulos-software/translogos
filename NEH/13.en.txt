On that day there was read in the book of Moses
because they have not come before the sons of Israel with bread and with water
And it cometh to pass
And before this Eliashib the priest
and he maketh for him a great chamber
And during all this I was not in Jerusalem
and I come in to Jerusalem
and it is very displeasing to me
and I speak
And I know that the portions of the Levites have not been given
And I strive with the prefects
and all Judah have brought in the tithe of the corn
And I appoint treasurers over the treasuries
Be mindful of me
In those days I have seen in Judah those treading wine-vats on sabbath
And the Tyrians have dwelt in it
And I strive with the freemen of Judah
Thus did not your fathers do? and our God bringeth in on us all this evil
And it cometh to pass
And they lodge -- the merchants and sellers of all ware -- at the outside of Jerusalem
and I testify against them
And I say to the Levites
Also
And of their sons
And I strive with them
`By these did not Solomon king of Israel sin? and among the many nations there was no king like him
And to you do we hearken to do all this great evil
And `one' of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest
Be mindful of them
And I have cleansed them from every stranger
and for the wood-offering at appointed times
