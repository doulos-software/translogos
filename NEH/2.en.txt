And it cometh to pass
and the king saith to me
and say to the king
And the king saith to me
and say to the king
And the king saith to me (and the queen is sitting near him)
And I say to the king
and a letter unto Asaph
And I come in unto the governors beyond the River
and Sanballat the Horonite heareth
And I come in unto Jerusalem
and I rise by night
And I go out through the gate of the valley by night
And I pass over unto the gate of the fountain
and I am going up through the brook by night
And the prefects have not known whither I have gone
and I say unto them
And I declare to them the hand of my God that is good upon me
And Sanballat the Horonite heareth
And I return them word
