Pray
For provocation slayeth the perverse
I -- I have seen the perverse taking root
Far are his sons from safety
Whose harvest the hungry doth eat
For sorrow cometh not forth from the dust
For man to misery is born
Yet I -- I inquire for God
Doing great things
Who is giving rain on the face of the land
To set the low on a high place
Making void thoughts of the subtile
Capturing the wise in their subtilty
By day they meet darkness
And He saveth the wasted from their mouth
And there is hope to the poor
Lo
For He doth pain
In six distresses He delivereth thee
In famine He hath redeemed thee from death
When the tongue scourgeth thou art hid
At destruction and at hunger thou mockest
(For with sons of the field `is' thy covenant
And thou hast known that thy tent `is' peace
And hast known that numerous `is' Thy seed
Thou comest in full age unto the grave
Lo
