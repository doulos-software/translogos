And Job answereth and saith: --"
O that my provocation were thoroughly weighed
For now
For arrows of the Mighty `are' with me
Brayeth a wild ass over tender grass? Loweth an ox over his provender?"
Eaten is an insipid thing without salt? Is there sense in the drivel of dreams?"
My soul is refusing to touch! They `are' as my sickening food."
O that my request may come
That God would please -- and bruise me
And yet it is my comfort
What `is' my power that I should hope? And what mine end That I should prolong my life?"
Is my strength the strength of stones? Is my flesh brazen?"
Is not my help with me
To a despiser of his friends `is' shame
My brethren have deceived as a brook
That are black because of ice
By the time they are warm they have been cut off
Turn aside do the paths of their way
Passengers of Tema looked expectingly
They were ashamed that one hath trusted
Surely now ye have become the same! Ye see a downfall
Is it because I said
And
Shew me
How powerful have been upright sayings
For reproof -- do you reckon words? And for wind -- sayings of the desperate."
Anger on the fatherless ye cause to fall
And
Turn back
Is there in my tongue perverseness? Discerneth not my palate desirable things?"
