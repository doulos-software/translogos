And Jehovah doth answer Job
Is the striver with the Mighty instructed? The reprover of God
And Job answereth Jehovah
Lo
Once I have spoken
And Jehovah answereth Job out of the whirlwind
Gird
Dost thou also make void My judgment? Dost thou condemn Me
And an arm like God hast thou? And with a voice like Him dost thou thunder?"
Put on
Scatter abroad the wrath of thine anger
See every proud one -- humble him
Hide them in the dust together
And even I -- I do praise thee
Lo
Lo
He doth bend his tail as a cedar
His bones `are' tubes of brass
He `is' a beginning of the ways of God
For food do mountains bear for him
Under shades he lieth down
Cover him do shades
Lo
Before his eyes doth `one' take him
