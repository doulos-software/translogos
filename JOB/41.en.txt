Dost thou draw leviathan with an angle? And with a rope thou lettest down -- his tongue?"
Dost thou put a reed in his nose? And with a thorn pierce his jaw?"
Doth he multiply unto thee supplications? Doth he speak unto thee tender things?"
Doth he make a covenant with thee? Dost thou take him for a servant age-during?"
Dost thou play with him as a bird? And dost thou bind him for thy damsels?"
(Feast upon him do companions
Dost thou fill with barbed irons his skin? And with fish-spears his head?"
Place on him thy hand
Lo
None so fierce that he doth awake him
Who hath brought before Me and I repay? Under the whole heavens it `is' mine."
I do not keep silent concerning his parts
Who hath uncovered the face of his clothing? Within his double bridle who doth enter?"
The doors of his face who hath opened? Round about his teeth `are' terrible."
A pride -- strong ones of shields
One unto another they draw nigh
One unto another they adhere
His sneezings cause light to shine
Out of his mouth do flames go
Out of his nostrils goeth forth smoke
His breath setteth coals on fire
In his neck lodge doth strength
The flakes of his flesh have adhered -- Firm upon him -- it is not moved."
His heart `is' firm as a stone
From his rising are the mighty afraid
The sword of his overtaker standeth not
He reckoneth iron as straw
The son of the bow doth not cause him to flee
As stubble have darts been reckoned
Under him `are' sharp points of clay
He causeth to boil as a pot the deep
After him he causeth a path to shine
There is not on the earth his like
Every high thing he doth see
