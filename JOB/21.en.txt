And Job answereth and saith: --"
Hear ye diligently my word
Bear with me
I -- to man `is' my complaint? and if `so'
Turn unto me
Yea
Wherefore do the wicked live? They have become old
Their seed is established
Their houses `are' peace without fear
His bullock hath eaten corn
They send forth as a flock their sucklings
They lift `themselves' up at timbrel and harp
They wear out in good their days
And they say to God
What `is' the Mighty One that we serve Him? And what do we profit when we meet with Him?'"
Lo
How oft is the lamp of the wicked extinguished
They are as straw before wind
God layeth up for his sons his sorrow
His own eyes see his destruction
For what `is' his delight in his house after him
To God doth `one' teach knowledge
This `one' dieth in his perfect strength
His breasts have been full of milk
And this `one' dieth with a bitter soul
Together -- on the dust they lie down
Lo
For ye say
Have ye not asked those passing by the way? And their signs do ye not know?"
That to a day of calamity is the wicked spared. To a day of wrath they are brought."
Who doth declare to his face his way? And `for' that which he hath done
And he -- to the graves he is brought. And over the heap a watch is kept."
Sweet to him have been the clods of the valley
And how do ye comfort me `with' vanity
