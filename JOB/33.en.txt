And yet
Lo
Of the uprightness of my heart `are' my sayings
The Spirit of God hath made me
If thou art able -- answer me
Lo
Lo
Surely -- thou hast said in mine ears
`Pure `am' I
Lo
He doth put in the stocks my feet
Lo
Wherefore against Him hast thou striven
For once doth God speak
In a dream -- a vision of night
Then He uncovereth the ear of men
To turn aside man `from' doing
He keepeth back his soul from corruption
And he hath been reproved With pain on his bed
And his life hath nauseated bread
His flesh is consumed from being seen
And draw near to the pit doth his soul
If there is by him a messenger
Then He doth favour him and saith
Fresher `is' his flesh than a child's
He maketh supplication unto God
He looketh on men
He hath ransomed my soul From going over into the pit
Lo
To bring back his soul from the pit
Attend
If there are words -- answer me
If there are not -- hearken thou to me
