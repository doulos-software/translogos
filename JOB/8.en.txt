And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: --"
Till when dost thou speak these things? And a strong wind -- sayings of thy mouth?"
Doth God pervert judgment? And doth the Mighty One pervert justice?"
If thy sons have sinned before Him
If thou dost seek early unto God
If pure and upright thou `art'
And thy beginning hath been small
For
(For of yesterday we `are'
Do they not shew thee -- speak to thee
`Doth a rush wise without mire? A reed increase without water?"
While it `is' in its budding -- uncropt
So `are' the paths of all forgetting God
Whose confidence is loathsome
He leaneth on his house -- and it standeth not: He taketh hold on it -- and it abideth not."
Green he `is' before the sun
By a heap his roots are wrapped
If `one' doth destroy him from his place
Lo
Lo
While he filleth with laughter thy mouth
Those hating thee do put on shame
