And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: --"
Doth a wise man answer `with' vain knowledge? And fill `with' an east wind his belly?"
To reason with a word not useful? And speeches -- no profit in them?"
Yea
For thy mouth teacheth thine iniquity
Thy mouth declareth thee wicked
The first man art thou born? And before the heights wast thou formed?"
Of the secret counsel of God dost thou hear? And withdrawest thou unto thee wisdom?"
What hast thou known
Both the gray-headed And the very aged `are' among us -- Greater than thy father `in' days."
Too few for thee are the comforts of God? And a gentle word `is' with thee
What -- doth thine heart take thee away? And what -- are thine eyes high?"
For thou turnest against God thy spirit? And hast brought out words from thy mouth:"
What `is' man that he is pure
Lo
Also -- surely abominable and filthy Is man drinking as water perverseness."
I shew thee -- hearken to me -- And this I have seen and declare:"
Which the wise declare -- And have not hid -- from their fathers."
To them alone was the land given
`All days of the wicked he is paining himself
A fearful voice `is' in his ears
He believeth not to return from darkness
He is wandering for bread -- `Where `is' it?' He hath known that ready at his hand Is a day of darkness."
Terrify him do adversity and distress
For he stretched out against God his hand
He runneth unto Him with a neck
For he hath covered his face with his fat
And he inhabiteth cities cut off
He is not rich
He turneth not aside from darkness
Let him not put credence in vanity
Not in his day is it completed
He shaketh off as a vine his unripe fruit
For the company of the profane `is' gloomy
To conceive misery
