And Job answereth and saith: --"
I have heard many such things
Is there an end to words of wind? Or what doth embolden thee that thou answerest?"
I also
I might harden you with my mouth
If I speak
Only
And Thou dost loathe me
His anger hath torn
They have gaped on me with their mouth
God shutteth me up unto the perverse
At ease I have been
Go round against me do his archers. He splitteth my reins
He breaketh me -- breach upon breach
Sackcloth I have sewed on my skin
My face is foul with weeping
Not for violence in my hands
O earth
Also
My interpreter `is' my friend
And he reasoneth for a man with God
When a few years do come
