And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: --"
When do ye set an end to words? Consider ye
Wherefore have we been reckoned as cattle? We have been defiled in your eyes!"
(He is tearing himself in his anger.) For thy sake is earth forsaken? And removed is a rock from its place?"
Also
The light hath been dark in his tent
Straitened are the steps of his strength
For he is sent into a net by his own feet
Seize on the heel doth a gin
Hidden in the earth is his cord
Round about terrified him have terrors
Hungry is his sorrow
It consumeth the parts of his skin
Drawn from his tent is his confidence
It dwelleth in his tent -- out of his provender
From beneath his roots are dried up
His memorial hath perished from the land
They thrust him from light unto darkness
He hath no continuator
At this day westerns have been astonished And easterns have taken fright."
Only these `are' tabernacles of the perverse
