And Zophar the Naamathite answereth and saith: --"
Is a multitude of words not answered? And is a man of lips justified?"
Thy devices make men keep silent
And thou sayest
And yet
And declare to thee secrets of wisdom
By searching dost thou find out God? Unto perfection find out the Mighty One?"
Heights of the heavens! -- what dost thou? Deeper than Sheol! -- what knowest thou?"
Longer than earth `is' its measure
If He pass on
For he hath known men of vanity
And empty man is bold
If thou -- thou hast prepared thy heart
If iniquity `is' in thy hand
For then thou liftest up thy face from blemish
For thou dost forget misery
And above the noon doth age rise
And thou hast trusted because their is hope
And thou hast rested
And the eyes of the wicked are consumed
