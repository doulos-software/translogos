After this hath Job opened his mouth
And Job answereth and saith: --"
Let the day perish in which I am born
That day -- let it be darkness
Let darkness and death-shade redeem it
That night -- let thick darkness take it
Lo! that night -- let it be gloomy
Let the cursers of day mark it
Let the stars of its twilight be dark
Because it hath not shut the doors Of the womb that was mine! And hide misery from mine eyes."
Why from the womb do I not die? From the belly I have come forth and gasp!"
Wherefore have knees been before me? And what `are' breasts
For now
With kings and counsellors of earth
Or with princes -- they have gold
(Or as a hidden abortion I am not
There the wicked have ceased troubling
Together prisoners have been at ease
Small and great `are' there the same. And a servant `is' free from his lord."
Why giveth He to the miserable light
Who are waiting for death
Who are glad -- unto joy
To a man whose way hath been hidden
For before my food
For a fear I feared and it meeteth me
I was not safe -- nor was I quiet -- Nor was I at rest -- and trouble cometh!"
