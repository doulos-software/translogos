And Elihu answereth and saith: --"
This hast thou reckoned for judgment: Thou hast said -- `My righteousness `is' more than God's?'"
For thou sayest
I return thee words
Behold attentively the heavens -- and see
If thou hast sinned
If thou hast been righteous
For a man like thyself `is' thy wickedness
Because of the multitude of oppressions They cause to cry out
And none said
Teaching us more than the beasts of the earth
There they cry
Surely vanity God doth not hear
Yea
And
And Job `with' vanity doth open his mouth
