And now
Also -- the power of their hands
With want and with famine gloomy
Those cropping mallows near a shrub
From the midst they are cast out
In a frightful place of valleys to dwell
Among shrubs they do groan
Sons of folly -- even sons without name
And now
They have abominated me
Because His cord He loosed and afflicteth me
On the right hand doth a brood arise
They have broken down my path
As a wide breach they come
He hath turned against me terrors
And now
At night my bone hath been pierced in me
By the abundance of power
Casting me into mire
I cry unto Thee
Thou art turned to be fierce to me
Thou dost lift me up
For I have known To death Thou dost bring me back
Surely not against the heap Doth He send forth the hand
Did not I weep for him whose day is hard? Grieved hath my soul for the needy."
When good I expected
My bowels have boiled
Mourning I have gone without the sun
A brother I have been to dragons
My skin hath been black upon me
And my harp doth become mourning
