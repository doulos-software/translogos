A covenant I made for mine eyes
And what `is' the portion of God from above? And the inheritance of the Mighty from the heights?"
Is not calamity to the perverse? And strangeness to workers of iniquity?"
Doth not He see my ways
If I have walked with vanity
He doth weigh me in righteous balances
If my step doth turn aside from the way
Let me sow -- and another eat
If my heart hath been enticed by woman
Grind to another let my wife
For it `is' a wicked thing
For a fire it `is'
If I despise the cause of my man-servant
Then what do I do when God ariseth? And when He doth inspect
Did not He that made me in the womb make him? Yea
If I withhold from pleasure the poor
And I do eat my morsel by myself
(But from my youth He grew up with me as `with' a father
If I see `any' perishing without clothing
If his loins have not blessed me
If I have waved at the fatherless my hand
My shoulder from its blade let fall
For a dread unto me `is' calamity `from' God
If I have made gold my confidence
If I rejoice because great `is' my wealth
If I see the light when it shineth
And my heart is enticed in secret
It also `is' a judicial iniquity
If I rejoice at the ruin of my hater
Yea
If not -- say ye
In the street doth not lodge a stranger
If I have covered as Adam my transgressions
Because I fear a great multitude
Who giveth to me a hearing? lo
If not -- on my shoulder I take it up
The number of my steps I tell Him
If against me my land doth cry out
If its strength I consumed without money
Instead of wheat let a thorn go forth
