And Job answereth and saith: --"
Truly I have known that `it is' so
If he delight to strive with Him -- He doth not answer him one of a thousand."
Wise in heart and strong in power -- Who hath hardened toward Him and is at peace?"
Who is removing mountains
Who is shaking earth from its place
Who is speaking to the sun
Stretching out the heavens by Himself
Making Osh
Doing great things till there is no searching
Lo
Lo
God doth not turn back His anger
How much less do I -- I answer Him? Choose out my words with Him?"
Whom
Though I had called and He answereth me
Because with a tempest He bruiseth me
He permitteth me not to refresh my spirit
If of power
If I be righteous
Perfect I am! -- I know not my soul
It is the same thing
If a scourge doth put to death suddenly
Earth hath been given Into the hand of the wicked one. The face of its judges he covereth
My days have been swifter than a runner
They have passed on with ships of reed
Though I say
I have been afraid of all my griefs
I -- I am become wicked; why `is' this? `In' vain I labour."
If I have washed myself with snow-water
Then in corruption Thou dost dip me
But if a man like myself -- I answer him
If there were between us an umpire
He doth turn aside from off me his rod
I speak
