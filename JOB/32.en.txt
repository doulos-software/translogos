And these three men cease from answering Job
and burn doth the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite
and against his three friends hath his anger burned
And Elihu hath waited earnestly beside Job with words
And Elihu seeth that there is no answer in the mouth of the three men
And Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answereth and saith: -- Young I `am' in days
I said: Days do speak
Surely a spirit is in man
The multitude are not wise
Therefore I have said: Hearken to me
Lo
And unto you I attend
Lest ye say
And he hath not set in array words for me
(They have broken down
And I have waited
I answer
For I have been full of words
Lo
I speak
Let me not
For I have not known to give flattering titles
