And the day is
And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary
And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary
And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith
Yet
And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary
And the Adversary goeth forth from the presence of Jehovah
And he taketh to him a potsherd to scrape himself with it
And his wife saith to him
And he saith unto her
And three of the friends of Job hear of all this evil that hath come upon him
and they lift up their eyes from afar and have not discerned him
And they sit with him on the earth seven days and seven nights
