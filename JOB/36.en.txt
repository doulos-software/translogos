And Elihu addeth and saith: --"
Honour me a little
I lift up my knowledge from afar
For
Lo
He reviveth not the wicked
He withdraweth not from the righteous His eyes
And if prisoners in fetters They are captured with cords of affliction
Then He declareth to them their work
And He uncovereth their ear for instruction
If they do hear and serve
And if they do not hearken
And the profane in heart set the face
Their soul dieth in youth
He draweth out the afflicted in his affliction
And also He moved thee from a strait place
And the judgment of the wicked thou hast fulfilled
Lest He move thee with a stroke
Doth He value thy riches? He hath gold
Desire not the night
Take heed -- do not turn unto iniquity
Lo
Who hath appointed unto Him his way? And who said
Remember that thou magnify His work That men have beheld."
All men have looked on it
Lo
When He doth diminish droppings of the waters
Which clouds do drop
Yea
Lo
For by them He doth judge peoples
By two palms He hath covered the light
He sheweth by it `to' his friend substance
