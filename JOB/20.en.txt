And Zophar the Naamathite answereth and saith: --"
Therefore my thoughts cause me to answer
The chastisement of my shame I hear
This hast thou known from antiquity? Since the placing of man on earth?"
That the singing of the wicked `is' short
Though his excellency go up to the heavens
As his own dung for ever he doth perish
As a dream he fleeth
The eye hath not seen him
His sons do the poor oppress
His bones have been full of his youth
Though he doth sweeten evil in his mouth
Hath pity on it
His food in his bowels is turned
Wealth he hath swallowed
Gall of asps he sucketh
He looketh not on rivulets
He is giving back `what' he laboured for
For he oppressed -- he forsook the poor
For he hath not known ease in his belly. With his desirable thing he delivereth not himself."
There is not a remnant to his food
In the fulness of his sufficiency he is straitened. Every perverse hand doth meet him."
It cometh to pass
He fleeth from an iron weapon
One hath drawn
All darkness is hid for his treasures
Reveal do the heavens his iniquity
Remove doth the increase of his house
This `is' the portion of a wicked man from God. And an inheritance appointed him by God."
