And Job addeth to lift up his simile
Who doth make me as `in' months past
In His causing His lamp to shine on my head
As I have been in days of my maturity
When yet the Mighty One `is' with me. Round about me -- my young ones
When washing my goings with butter
When I go out to the gate by the city
Seen me have youths
Princes have kept in words
The voice of leaders hath been hidden
For the ear heard
For I deliver the afflicted who is crying
The blessing of the perishing cometh on me
Righteousness I have put on
Eyes I have been to the blind
A father I `am' to the needy
And I break the jaw-teeth of the perverse
And I say
My root is open unto the waters
My honour `is' fresh with me
To me they have hearkened
After my word they change not
And they wait as `for' rain for me
I laugh unto them -- they give no credence
I choose their way
