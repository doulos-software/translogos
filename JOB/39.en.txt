Hast thou known the time of The bearing of the wild goats of the rock? The bringing forth of hinds thou dost mark!"
Thou dost number the months they fulfil? And thou hast known the time of their bringing forth!"
They bow down
Safe are their young ones
Who hath sent forth the wild ass free? Yea
Whose house I have made the wilderness
He doth laugh at the multitude of a city
The range of mountains `is' his pasture
Is a Reem willing to serve thee? Doth he lodge by thy crib?"
Dost thou bind a Reem in a furrow `with' his thick band? Doth he harrow valleys after thee?"
Dost thou trust in him because great `is' his power? And dost thou leave unto him thy labour?"
Dost thou trust in him That he doth bring back thy seed? And `to' thy threshing-floor doth gather `it'?"
The wing of the rattling ones exulteth
For she leaveth on the earth her eggs
And she forgetteth that a foot may press it
Her young ones it hath hardened without her
For God hath caused her to forget wisdom
At the time on high she lifteth herself up
Dost thou give to the horse might? Dost thou clothe his neck `with' a mane?"
Dost thou cause him to rush as a locust? The majesty of his snorting `is' terrible."
They dig in a valley
He laugheth at fear
Against him rattle doth quiver
With trembling and rage he swalloweth the ground
Among the trumpets he saith
By thine understanding flieth a hawk? Spreadeth he his wings to the south?"
At thy command goeth an eagle up high? Or lifteth he up his nest?"
A rock he doth inhabit
From thence he hath sought food
And his brood gulph up blood
