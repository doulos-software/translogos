And Job answereth Jehovah and saith: --"
Thou hast known that `for' all things Thou art able
`Who `is' this
`Hear
By the hearing of the ear I heard Thee
Therefore do I loathe `it'
And it cometh to pass after Jehovah's speaking these words unto Job
And now
And they go -- Eliphaz the Temanite
And Jehovah hath turned `to' the captivity of Job in his praying for his friends
And come unto him do all his brethren
And Jehovah hath blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning
And he hath seven sons and three daughters;"
and he calleth the name of the one Jemima
And there have not been found women fair as the daughters of Job in all the land
And Job liveth after this a hundred and forty years
and Job dieth
