Also
Hearken diligently to the trembling of His voice
Under the whole heavens He directeth it
After it roar doth a voice -- He thundereth with the voice of His excellency
God thundereth with His voice wonderfully
For to snow He saith
Into the hand of every man he sealeth
And enter doth the beast into covert
From the inner chamber cometh a hurricane
From the breath of God is frost given
Yea
And it is turning itself round by His counsels
Whether for a rod
Hear this
Dost thou know when God doth place them
Dost thou know the balancings of a cloud? The wonders of the Perfect in knowledge?"
How thy garments `are' warm
Thou hast made an expanse with Him For the clouds -- strong as a hard mirror!"
Let us know what we say to Him
Is it declared to Him that I speak? If a man hath spoken
And now
From the golden north it cometh
The Mighty! we have not found Him out
Therefore do men fear Him
