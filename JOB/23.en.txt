And Job answereth and saith: --"
Also -- to-day `is' my complaint bitter
O that I had known -- and I find Him
I arrange before Him the cause
I know the words He doth answer me
In the abundance of power doth He strive with me? No! surely He putteth `it' in me."
There the upright doth reason with Him
Lo
`To' the left in His working -- and I see not
For He hath known the way with me
On His step hath my foot laid hold
The command of His lips
And He `is' in one `mind'
For He doth complete my portion
Therefore
And God hath made my heart soft
For I have not been cut off before darkness
