Wherefore from the Mighty One Times have not been hidden
The borders they reach
The ass of the fatherless they lead away
They turn aside the needy from the way
Lo
In a field his provender they reap
The naked they cause to lodge Without clothing. And there is no covering in the cold."
From the inundation of hills they are wet
They take violently away From the breast the orphan
Naked
Between their walls they make oil
Because of enmity men do groan
They have been among rebellious ones of light
At the light doth the murderer rise
And the eye of an adulterer Hath observed the twilight
He hath dug in the darkness -- houses; By day they shut themselves up
When together
Light he `is' on the face of the waters
Drought -- also heat -- consume snow-waters
Forget him doth the womb
Treating evil the barren `who' beareth not
And hath drawn the mighty by his power
He giveth to him confidence
High they were `for' a little
And if not now
