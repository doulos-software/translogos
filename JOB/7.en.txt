Is there not a warfare to man on earth? And as the days of an hireling his days?"
As a servant desireth the shadow
So I have been caused to inherit months of vanity
If I lay down then I said
Clothed hath been my flesh `with' worms
My days swifter than a weaving machine
Remember Thou that my life `is' a breath
The eye of my beholder beholdeth me not. Thine eyes `are' upon me -- and I am not."
Consumed hath been a cloud
He turneth not again to his house
Also I -- I withhold not my mouth -- I speak in the distress of my spirit
A sea-`monster' am I
When I said
And thou hast affrighted me with dreams
And my soul chooseth strangling
I have wasted away -- not to the age do I live. Cease from me
What `is' man that Thou dost magnify him? And that Thou settest unto him Thy heart?"
And inspectest him in the mornings
How long dost Thou not look from me? Thou dost not desist till I swallow my spittle."
I have sinned
Thou dost not take away my transgression
