Man
As a flower he hath gone forth
Also -- on this Thou hast opened Thine eyes
Who giveth a clean thing out of an unclean? not one."
If determined are his days
Look away from off him that he may cease
For there is of a tree hope
If its root becometh old in the earth
From the fragrance of water it doth flourish
And a man dieth
Waters have gone away from a sea
And man hath lain down
O that in Sheol Thou wouldst conceal me
If a man dieth -- doth he revive? All days of my warfare I wait
Thou dost call
But now
Sealed up in a bag `is' my transgression
And yet
Stones have waters worn away
Thou prevailest `over' him for ever
Honoured are his sons
Only -- his flesh for him is pained
