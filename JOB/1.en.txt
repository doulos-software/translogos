A man there hath been in the land of Uz -- Job his name -- and that man hath been perfect and upright -- both fearing God
And there are borne to him seven sons and three daughters
and his substance is seven thousand sheep
And his sons have gone and made a banquet -- the house of each `in' his day -- and have sent and called to their three sisters to eat and to drink with them;"
and it cometh to pass
And the day is
And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary
And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary
And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith
Hast not Thou made a hedge for him
The work of his hands Thou hast blessed
And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary
And the day is
And a messenger hath come in unto Job and saith
and Sheba doth fall
While this `one' is speaking another also hath come and saith
While this `one' is speaking another also hath come and saith
While this `one' is speaking another also hath come and saith
And lo
And Job riseth
and he saith
In all this Job hath not sinned
