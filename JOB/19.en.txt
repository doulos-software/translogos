And Job answereth and saith: --"
Till when do ye afflict my soul
These ten times ye put me to shame
And also -- truly
If
Know now
Lo
My way He hedged up
Mine honour from off me He hath stripped
He breaketh me down round about
And He kindleth against me His anger
Come in do His troops together
My brethren from me He hath put far off
Ceased have my neighbours And my familiar friends have forgotten me
Sojourners of my house and my maids
To my servant I have called
My spirit is strange to my wife
Also sucklings have despised me
Abominate me do all the men of my counsel
To my skin and to my flesh Cleaved hath my bone
Pity me
Why do you pursue me as God? And with my flesh are not satisfied?"
Who doth grant now
With a pen of iron and lead -- For ever in a rock they may be hewn."
That -- I have known my Redeemer
And after my skin hath compassed this `body'
Whom I -- I see on my side
But ye say
Be ye afraid because of the sword
