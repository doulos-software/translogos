And Job answereth and saith: --"
Truly -- ye `are' the people
I also have a heart like you
A laughter to his friend I am: `He calleth to God
A torch -- despised in the thoughts of the secure Is prepared for those sliding with the feet."
At peace are the tents of spoilers
And yet
Or talk to the earth
`Who hath not known in all these
In whose hand `is' the breath of every living thing
Doth not the ear try words? And the palate taste food for itself?"
With the very aged `is' wisdom
With Him `are' wisdom and might
Lo
Lo
With Him `are' strength and wisdom
Causing counsellors to go away a spoil
The bands of kings He hath opened
Causing ministers to go away a spoil And strong ones He overthroweth."
Turning aside the lip of the stedfast
Pouring contempt upon princes
Removing deep things out of darkness
Magnifying the nations
Turning aside the heart Of the heads of the people of the land
They feel darkness
