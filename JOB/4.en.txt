And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: --"
Hath one tried a word with thee? -- Thou art weary! And to keep in words who is able?"
Lo
The stumbling one do thy words raise up
But now
Is not thy reverence thy confidence? Thy hope -- the perfection of thy ways?"
Remember
As I have seen -- ploughers of iniquity
From the breath of God they perish
The roaring of a lion
An old lion is perishing without prey
And unto me a thing is secretly brought
In thoughts from visions of the night
Fear hath met me
And a spirit before my face doth pass
It standeth
`Is mortal man than God more righteous? Than his Maker is a man cleaner?"
Lo
Also -- the inhabitants of houses of clay
From morning to evening are beaten down
Hath not their excellency been removed with them? They die
