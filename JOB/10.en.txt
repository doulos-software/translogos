My soul hath been weary of my life
I say unto God
Is it good for Thee that Thou dost oppress? That Thou despisest the labour of Thy hands
Eyes of flesh hast Thou? As man seeth -- seest Thou?"
As the days of man `are' Thy days? Thy years as the days of a man?"
That Thou inquirest for mine iniquity
For Thou knowest that I am not wicked
Thy hands have taken pains about me
Remember
Dost Thou not as milk pour me out? And as cheese curdle me?"
Skin and flesh Thou dost put on me
Life and kindness Thou hast done with me. And Thy inspection hath preserved my spirit."
And these Thou hast laid up in Thy heart
If I sinned
If I have done wickedly -- wo to me
And it riseth -- as a lion Thou huntest me. And Thou turnest back -- Thou shewest Thyself wonderful in me."
Thou renewest Thy witnesses against me
And why from the womb Hast Thou brought me forth? I expire
As I had not been
Are not my days few? Cease then
Before I go
A land of obscurity as thick darkness
