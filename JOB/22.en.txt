And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: --"
To God is a man profitable
Is it a delight to the Mighty One That thou art righteous? is it gain
Because of thy reverence Doth He reason `with' thee? He entereth with thee into judgment:"
Is not thy wickedness abundant? And there is no end to thine iniquities."
For thou takest a pledge of thy brother for nought
Thou causest not the weary to drink water
As to the man of arm -- he hath the earth
Widows thou hast sent away empty
Therefore round about thee `are' snares
Or darkness -- thou dost not see
Is not God high `in' heaven? And see the summit of the stars
And thou hast said
Thick clouds `are' a secret place to Him
The path of the age dost thou observe
Who have been cut down unexpectedly
Those saying to God
And he hath filled their houses `with' good: (And the counsel of the wicked Hath been far from me.)"
See do the righteous and they rejoice
`Surely our substance hath not been cut off
Acquaint thyself
Receive
If thou dost return unto the Mighty Thou art built up
So as to set on the dust a defence
And the Mighty hath been thy defence
For then on the Mighty thou delightest thyself
Thou dost make supplication unto Him
And thou decreest a saying
For they have made low
He delivereth the not innocent
