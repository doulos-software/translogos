What -- thou hast helped the powerless
What -- thou hast given counsel to the unwise
With whom hast thou declared words? And whose breath came forth from thee?"

Taking hold of the face of the throne

Pillars of the heavens do tremble
By His power He hath quieted the sea
By His Spirit the heavens He beautified
