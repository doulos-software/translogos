And Elihu answereth and saith:"
Hear
For the ear doth try words
Judgment let us choose for ourselves
For Job hath said
Against my right do I lie? Mortal `is' mine arrow -- without transgression.'"
Who `is' a man like Job? He drinketh scoffing like water
And he hath travelled for company With workers of iniquity
For he hath said
Therefore
For the work of man he repayeth to him
Yea
Who hath inspected for Himself the earth? And who hath placed all the habitable world?"
If He doth set on him His heart
Expire doth all flesh together
And if `there is' understanding
Yea
Who hath said to a king -- `Worthless
That hath not accepted the person of princes
`In' a moment they die
For His eyes `are' on the ways of each
There is no darkness nor death-shade
For He doth not suffer man any more
He breaketh the mighty -- no searching! And He appointeth others in their stead."
Therefore He knoweth their works
As wicked He hath stricken them
Because that against right They have turned aside from after Him
To cause to come in unto Him The cry of the poor
And He giveth rest
From the reigning of a profane man
For unto God hath any said: `I have taken away
Besides `that which' I see
By thee doth He recompense
Let men of heart say to me
Job -- not with knowledge doth he speak
My Father! let Job be tried -- unto victory
For he doth add to his sin
