My spirit hath been destroyed
If not -- mockeries `are' with me. And in their provocations mine eye lodgeth."
Place
For their heart Thou hast hidden From understanding
For a portion he sheweth friendship
And he set me up for a proverb of the peoples
And dim from sorrow is mine eye
Astonished are the upright at this
And the righteous layeth hold `on' his way
Return
My days have passed by
Night for day they appoint
If I wait -- Sheol `is' my house
To corruption I have called: -- `Thou `art' my father.' `My mother' and `my sister' -- to the worm."
And where `is' now my hope? Yea
`To' the parts of Sheol ye go down
