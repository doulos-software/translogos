And Job addeth to lift up his simile
God liveth! He turned aside my judgment
For all the while my breath `is' in me
My lips do not speak perverseness
Pollution to me -- if I justify you
On my righteousness I have laid hold
As the wicked is my enemy
For what `is' the hope of the profane
His cry doth God hear
On the Mighty doth he delight himself? Call God at all times?"
I shew you by the hand of God
Lo
This `is' the portion of wicked man with God
If his sons multiply -- for them `is' a sword. And his offspring `are' not satisfied `with' bread."
His remnant in death are buried
If he heap up as dust silver
He prepareth -- and the righteous putteth `it' on
He hath built as a moth his house
Rich he lieth down
Overtake him as waters do terrors
Take him up doth an east wind
And it casteth at him
It clappeth at him its hands
