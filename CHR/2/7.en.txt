and the priests have not been able to go in unto the house of Jehovah

And Jehovah appeareth unto Solomon by night

and My people on whom My name is called be humbled
`Now

`And thou

and if ye turn back -- ye -- and have forsaken My statutes
and this house that I have sanctified for My name
`And this house that hath been high
and they have said
