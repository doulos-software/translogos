After these things and this truth
And Hezekiah seeth that Sennacherib hath come
and he taketh counsel with his heads and his mighty ones
and much people are gathered
And he strengtheneth himself
And he putteth heads of war over the people
`Be strong and courageous
With him `is' an arm of flesh
After this hath Sennacherib king of Asshur sent his servants to Jerusalem -- and he `is' by Lachish
`Thus said Sennacherib king of Asshur
`Is not Hezekiah persuading you
Hath not Hezekiah himself turned aside His high places
`Do ye not know what I have done -- I and my fathers -- to all peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands at all able to deliver their land out of my hand?"
Who among all the gods of these nations whom my fathers have devoted to destruction `is' he who hath been able to deliver his people out of my hand
`And
And again have his servants spoken against Jehovah God
and letters he hath written to give reproach to Jehovah
And they call with a great voice `in' Jewish
and they speak against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the peoples of the land -- work of the hands of man."
And Hezekiah the king prayeth
and Jehovah sendeth a messenger
And Jehovah saveth Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Asshur
and many are bringing in an offering to Jehovah
In those days hath Hezekiah been sick even unto death
and Hezekiah hath not returned according to the deed `done' unto him
and Hezekiah is humbled for the loftiness of his heart
And Hezekiah hath riches and honour very much
and storehouses for the increase of corn
and cities he hath made for himself
And Hezekiah himself hath stopped the upper source of the waters of Gihon
and so with the ambassadors of the heads of Babylon
And the rest of the matters of Hezekiah
And Hezekiah lieth with his fathers
