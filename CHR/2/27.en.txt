A son of twenty and five years `is' Jotham in his reigning
And he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah
He hath built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah
and cities he hath built in the hill-country of Judah
And he hath fought with the king of the sons of Ammon
And Jotham doth strengthen himself
And the rest of the matters of Jotham
A son of twenty and five years was he in his reigning
and Jotham lieth with his fathers
