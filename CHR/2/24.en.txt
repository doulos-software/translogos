A son of seven years `is' Joash in his reigning
And Joash doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest."
And Jehoiada taketh for him two wives
And it cometh to pass after this
and he gathereth the priests and the Levites
And the king calleth for Jehoiada the head
for sons of Athaliah
And the king speaketh
and give an intimation in Judah and in Jerusalem to bring in to Jehovah the tribute of Moses
And all the heads
And it cometh to pass
And the king and Jehoiada give it unto the doers of the work of the service of the house of Jehovah
And those doing the business work
And at their completing `it'
And Jehoiada is aged and satisfied with days
and they bury him in the city of David
And after the death of Jehoiada come in have heads of Judah
and they forsake the house of Jehovah
And He sendeth among them prophets
and the Spirit of God hath clothed Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest
And they conspire against him
and Joash the king hath not remembered the kindness that Jehoiada his father did with him
And it cometh to pass
for with few men have the force of Aram come in
And in their going from him -- for they left him with many diseases -- his servants themselves have conspired against him
And these `are' those conspiring against him
As to his sons
