And Rehoboam cometh in to Jerusalem
And a word of Jehovah is unto Shemaiah
`Speak unto Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah
Thus said Jehovah
And Rehoboam dwelleth in Jerusalem
yea
and Beth-Zur
and Gath
and Adoraim
and Zorah
And he strengtheneth the bulwarks
and in every city and city targets and spears
And the priests
for the Levites have left their suburbs and their possession
and he establisheth to him priests for high places
and after them
And they strengthen the kingdom of Judah
And Rehoboam taketh to him a wife
And she beareth to him sons
And after her he hath taken Maachah daughter of Absalom
And Rehoboam loveth Maachah daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines -- for eighteen wives he hath taken
And Rehoboam appointeth for head Abijah son of Maachah
And he hath understanding
