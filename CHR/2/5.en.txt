And all the work that Solomon made for the house of Jehovah is finished
Then doth Solomon assemble the elders of Israel
And assembled unto the king are all the men of Israel in the feast -- it `is' the seventh month;"
and all the elders of Israel come in
and they bring up the ark
and king Solomon and all the company of Israel who are convened unto him before the ark are sacrificing sheep and oxen
And the priests bring in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place
and the cherubs are spreading out wings over the place of the ark
and they lengthen the staves
There is nothing in the ark but the two tables that Moses gave in Horeb
And it cometh to pass
and the Levites
yea
and the priests have not been able to stand to minister from the presence of the cloud
