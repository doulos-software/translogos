A son of twenty years `is' Ahaz in his reigning
and walketh in the ways of the kings of Israel
and himself hath made perfume in the valley of the son of Hinnom
and sacrificeth and maketh perfume in high places
And Jehovah his God giveth him into the hand of the king of Aram
And Pekah son of Remaliah slayeth in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day (the whole `are' sons of valour)
And Zichri
And the sons of Israel take captive of their brethren
And there hath been there a prophet of Jehovah (Oded `is' his name)
and now
and now
And certain of the heads of the sons of Ephraim (Azariah son of Johanan
and say to them
And the armed men leave the captives and the prey before the heads and all the assembly;"
and the men who have been expressed by name rise and take hold on the captives
At that time hath king Ahaz sent unto the king of Asshur to give help to him;"
and again the Edomites have come
And the Philistines have rushed against the cities of the low country
for Jehovah hath humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel
And Tilgath-Pilneser king of Asshur cometh in unto him
though Ahaz hath taken a portion `out' of the house of Jehovah
And in the time of his distress -- he addeth to trespass against Jehovah
and he sacrificeth to the gods of Damascus -- those smiting him
And Ahaz gathereth the vessels of the house of God
And in every city and city of Judah he hath made high places to make perfume to other gods
And the rest of his matters
And Ahaz lieth with his fathers
