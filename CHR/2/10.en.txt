And Rehoboam goeth to Shechem
And it cometh to pass
and they send and call for him
`Thy father made our yoke sharp
And he saith unto them
And king Rehoboam consulteth with the aged men who have been standing before Solomon his father in his being alive
And they speak unto him
And he forsaketh the counsel of the aged men that they counselled him
and he saith unto them
And the lads who have grown up with him
and now
And Jeroboam cometh in
And the king answereth them sharply
and speaketh unto them according to the counsel of the lads
And the king hath not hearkened unto the people
And all Israel have seen that the king hath not hearkened to them
As to the sons of Israel who are dwelling in the cities of Judah -- Rehoboam reigneth over them."
And king Rehoboam sendeth Hadoram
and Israel transgress against the house of David unto this day."
