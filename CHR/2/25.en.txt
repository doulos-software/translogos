A son of twenty and five years hath Amaziah reigned
and he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah -- only
And it cometh to pass
and their sons he hath not put to death
And Amaziah gathereth Judah
And he hireth out of Israel a hundred thousand mighty ones of valour
and a man of God hath come in unto him
but if thou art going -- do `it'
And Amaziah saith to the man of God
And Amaziah separateth them -- for the troop that hath come in unto him from Ephraim to go to their own place
And Amaziah hath strengthened himself
And ten thousand alive have the sons of Judah taken captive
And the sons of the troop that Amaziah hath sent back from going with him to battle -- they rush against cities of Judah
And it cometh to pass
And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Amaziah
And it cometh to pass
And Amaziah king of Judah taketh counsel
`Come
Thou hast said
And Amaziah hath not hearkened
and go up doth Joash king of Israel
and Judah is smitten before Israel
And Amaziah king of Judah
and `taketh' all the gold
And Amaziah son of Joash
and the rest of the matters of Amaziah
And from the time that Amaziah hath turned aside from after Jehovah -- they make a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem
and lift him up on the horses
