Then said Solomon
and I -- I have built a house of habitation for Thee
And the king turneth round his face
and he saith
`From the day that I brought out My people from the land of Egypt
and I fix on Jerusalem for My name being there
`And it is with the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah God of Israel
and Jehovah saith unto David my father
but thou dost not build the house
`And Jehovah doth establish His word that He spake
and I place there the ark
And he standeth before the altar of Jehovah
for Solomon hath made a scaffold of brass
and saith
who hast kept for Thy servant David my father that which Thou didst speak to him; yea
`And now
`And now
(for is it true? -- God dwelleth with man on the earth! Lo
`And Thou hast turned unto the prayer of Thy servant
for Thine eyes being open towards this house by day and by night
`And Thou hast hearkened unto the supplications of Thy servant
`If a man doth sin against his neighbour
then Thou dost hear from the heavens
`And if Thy people Israel is smitten before an enemy
then Thou dost hear from the heavens
`In the heavens being restrained
then Thou dost hear in the heavens
`Famine
any prayer
then Thou dost hear from the heavens
so that they fear Thee
`And also
then Thou dost hear from the heavens
`When Thy people doth go out to battle against its enemies in the way that Thou dost send them
then Thou hast heard from the heavens their prayer and their supplication
`When they sin against Thee -- for there is not a man who sinneth not -- and Thou hast been angry with them
and they have turned `it' back unto their heart in the land whither they have been taken captive
yea
then Thou hast heard from the heavens
`Now
and now
O Jehovah God
