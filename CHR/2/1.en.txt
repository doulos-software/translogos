And strengthen himself doth Solomon son of David over his kingdom
And Solomon saith to all Israel
and they go -- Solomon
but the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-Jearim
and the altar of brass that Bezaleel son of Uri
And Solomon goeth up thither
In that night hath God appeared to Solomon
And Solomon saith to God
Now
now
And God saith to Solomon
the wisdom and the knowledge is given to thee
And Solomon cometh in `from' the high place that `is' in Gibeon to Jerusalem
and Solomon gathereth chariots and horsemen
And the king maketh the silver and the gold in Jerusalem as stones
And the source of the horses that `are' to Solomon `is' from Egypt and from Keva; merchants of the king from Keva take at a price
and they come up
