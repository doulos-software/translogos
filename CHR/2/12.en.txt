And it cometh to pass
And it cometh to pass
with a thousand and two hundred chariots
and he captureth the cities of the bulwarks that `are' to Judah
And Shemaiah the prophet hath come in unto Rehoboam and the heads of Judah who have been gathered unto Jerusalem from the presence of Shishak
and the heads of Israel are humbled
And when Jehovah seeth that they have been humbled
but they become servants to him
And Shishak king of Egypt cometh up against Jerusalem
and king Rehoboam maketh in their stead shields of brass
and it cometh to pass
And in his being humbled
And king Rehoboam strengtheneth himself in Jerusalem
and he doth the evil thing
And the matters of Rehoboam
and Rehoboam lieth with his fathers
