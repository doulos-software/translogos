And Jehoshaphat hath riches and honour in abundance
and goeth down at the end of `certain' years unto Ahab to Samaria
And Ahab king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah
And Jehoshaphat saith unto the king of Israel
And the king of Israel gathereth the prophets
And Jehoshaphat saith
And the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat
And the king of Israel calleth unto a certain officer
And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah are sitting
And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah maketh for himself horns of iron
With these thou dost push Aram till thou hast consumed them.' And all the prophets are prophesying so
And the messenger who hath gone to call for Micaiah hath spoken unto him
And Micaiah saith `Jehovah liveth
And he cometh in unto the king
And the king saith unto him
And he saith
And the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat
And he saith
and Jehovah saith
And go out doth the spirit
and he saith
And
And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah cometh nigh
And Micaiah saith
And the king of Israel saith
and ye have said
And Micaiah saith
And the king of Israel goeth up
and the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat to disguise himself
And the king of Aram hath commanded the heads of the charioteers whom he hath
And it cometh to pass at the heads of the charioteers seeing Jehoshaphat
yea
And a man hath drawn with a bow
And the battle increaseth on that day
