And Abijah lieth with his fathers
And Asa doth that which is good
and turneth aside the altars of the stranger
and saith to Judah to seek Jehovah
and he turneth aside out of all cities of Judah the high places and the images
And he buildeth cities of bulwarks in Judah
And he saith to Judah
And there is to Asa a force bearing target and spear
And come out unto them doth Zerah the Cushite with a force of a thousand thousand
and Asa goeth out before him
And Asa calleth unto Jehovah his God
And Jehovah smiteth the Cushim before Asa
and Asa and the people who `are' with him pursue them even to Gerar
and smite all the cities round about Gerar
and also tents of cattle they have smitten
