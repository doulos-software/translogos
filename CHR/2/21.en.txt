And Jehoshaphat lieth with his fathers
And he hath brethren
and their father giveth to them many gifts of silver and of gold
And Jehoram riseth up over the kingdom of his father
A son of thirty and two years `is' Jehoram in his reigning
and he walketh in the way of the kings of Israel
and Jehovah hath not been willing to destroy the house of David
In his days hath Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah
and Jehoram passeth over with his heads
and Edom revolteth from under the hand of Judah unto this day; then doth Libnah revolt at that time from under his hand
also
And there cometh in unto him a writing from Elijah the prophet
and thou dost walk in the way of the kings of Israel
lo
and thou
And Jehovah waketh up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines
and they come up into Judah
And after all this hath Jehovah plagued him in his bowels by a disease for which there is no healing
and it cometh to pass
A son of thirty and two `years' was he in his reigning
