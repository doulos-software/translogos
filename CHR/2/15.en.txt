And upon Azariah son of Oded hath been the Spirit of God
and he goeth out before Asa
and many days `are' to Israel without a true God
and it turneth back in its distress unto Jehovah
and in those times there is no peace to him who is going out
and they have been beaten down
and ye
And at Asa's hearing these words
and gathereth all Judah and Benjamin
And they are gathered to Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa
and sacrifice to Jehovah on that day from the spoil they have brought in -- oxen seven hundred
and they enter into a covenant to seek Jehovah
and every one who doth not seek for Jehovah
And they swear to Jehovah with a loud voice
and rejoice do all Judah concerning the oath
And also Maachah
yet the high places have not turned aside from Israel; only
And he bringeth in the sanctified things of his father
And war hath not been till the thirty and fifth year of the reign of Asa."
