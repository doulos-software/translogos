And all the people of Judah take Uzziah (and he `is' a son of sixteen years)
He hath built Eloth
A son of sixteen years `is' Uzziah in his reigning
And he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah
and he is as one seeking God in the days of Zechariah who hath understanding in visions of God: and in the days of his seeking Jehovah
And he goeth forth
And God helpeth him against the Philistines
And the Ammonites give a present to Uzziah
And Uzziah buildeth towers in Jerusalem
and he buildeth towers in the wilderness
And Uzziah hath a force
The whole number of heads of the fathers of the mighty ones of valour `is' two thousand and six hundred;"
and by their hand `is' the force of the host
And Uzziah prepareth for them
And he maketh in Jerusalem inventions -- a device of an inventor -- to be on the towers
And at his being strong his heart hath been high unto destruction
And Azariah the priest goeth in after him
and they stand up against Uzziah the king
And Uzziah is wroth
And Azariah the head priest looketh unto him
And Uzziah the king is a leper unto the day of his death
And the rest of the matters of Uzziah
and Uzziah lieth with his fathers
