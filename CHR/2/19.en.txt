And Jehoshaphat king of Judah turneth back unto his house in peace to Jerusalem
and go out unto his presence doth Jehu son of Hanani
but good things have been found with thee
And Jehoshaphat dwelleth in Jerusalem
And he establisheth judges in the land
and saith unto the judges

and he layeth a charge upon them
and any strife that cometh in unto you of your brethren who are dwelling in their cities
`And
