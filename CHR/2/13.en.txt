In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam -- Abijah reigneth over Judah;"
three years he hath reigned in Jerusalem
And Abijah directeth the war with a force of mighty men of war
And Abijah riseth up on the hill of Zemaraim that `is' in the hill-country of Ephraim
Is it not for you to know that Jehovah
and rise up doth Jeroboam
`And there are gathered unto him vain men
`And now
`Have ye not cast out the priests of Jehovah
`As for us
and are making perfume to Jehovah
`And lo
And Jeroboam hath brought round the ambush to come in from behind them
And Judah turneth
and the men of Judah shout -- and it cometh to pass
And the sons of Israel flee from the face of Judah
and Abijah and his people smite among them a great smiting
And the sons of Israel are humbled at that time
And Abijah pursueth after Jeroboam
And Jeroboam hath not retained power any more in the days of Abijah
And Abijah strengtheneth himself
and the rest of the matters of Abijah
