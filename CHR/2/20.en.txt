And it cometh to pass after this
And they come in and declare to Jehoshaphat
And Jehoshaphat feareth
and Judah is gathered to inquire of Jehovah; also
And Jehoshaphat standeth in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem
and saith
`Art not Thou our God? Thou hast dispossessed the inhabitants of this land from before Thy people Israel
and they dwell in it
If evil doth come upon us -- sword
`And now
and lo
`O our God
And all Judah are standing before Jehovah
And upon Jahaziel
and he saith
To-morrow
Not for you to fight in this; station yourselves
And Jehoshaphat boweth -- face to the earth -- and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem have fallen before Jehovah
And the Levites
And they rise early in the morning
And he taketh counsel with the people
And at the time they have begun with singing and praise
and the sons of Ammon stand up
And Judah hath come in unto the watch-tower
and Jehoshaphat cometh in
And on the fourth day they have been assembled at the valley of Blessing
And they turn back
And they come in to Jerusalem with psalteries
And there is a fear of God on all kingdoms of the lands in their hearing that Jehovah hath fought with the enemies of Israel
and the kingdom of Jehoshaphat is quiet
And Jehoshaphat reigneth over Judah
And he walketh in the way of his father Asa
Only
And the rest of the matters of Jehoshaphat
And after this hath Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel
and he joineth him with himself to make ships to go to Tarshish
and prophesy doth Eliezer son of Dodavah
