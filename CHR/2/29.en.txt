Hezekiah hath reigned -- a son of twenty and five years
and he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah
He
and bringeth in the priests and the Levites
And he saith to them
for our fathers have trespassed
`Also -- they have shut the doors of the porch
and the wrath of Jehovah is on Judah and Jerusalem
And lo
`Now -- with my heart -- to make a covenant before Jehovah
My sons
And the Levites rise -- Mahath son of Amasai
and of the sons of Elizaphan: Shimri
and of the sons of Heman: Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun: Shemaiah and Uzziel --"
and they gather their brethren
and the priests come in to the inner part of the house of Jehovah to cleanse `it'
And they begin on the first of the first month to sanctify
And they come in within unto Hezekiah the king
and all the vessels that king Ahaz cast away in his reign -- in his trespass -- we have prepared and sanctified
And Hezekiah the king riseth early
and they bring in seven bullocks
And they slaughter the oxen
and they bring nigh the he-goats of the sin-offering before the king and the assembly
and the priests slaughter them
And he appointeth the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals
and the Levites stand with the instruments of David
And Hezekiah saith to cause the burnt-offering to ascend on the altar; and at the time the burnt-offering began -- began the song of Jehovah
And all the assembly are doing obeisance
And at the completion of the offering up bowed have the king and all those found with him
And Hezekiah the king saith
And Hezekiah answereth and saith
And the number of the burnt-offerings that the assembly have brought in
And the sanctified things `are' oxen six hundred
Only
And also
and rejoice doth Hezekiah and all the people
