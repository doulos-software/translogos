And Hezekiah sendeth unto all Israel and Judah
And the king taketh counsel
for they have not been able to make it at that time
And the thing is right in the eyes of the king
and they establish the thing
And the runners go with letters from the hand of the king and his heads
and do not be like your fathers
`Now
for in your turning back unto Jehovah
And the runners are passing over from city to city
only
Also
and much people are gathered to Jerusalem
And they arise and turn aside the altars that `are' in Jerusalem
and they slaughter the passover-offering on the fourteenth of the second month
And they stand on their station according to their ordinance; according to the law of Moses the man of God the priests are sprinkling the blood out of the hand of the Levites
for many `are' in the assembly who have not sanctified themselves
for a multitude of the people
who hath prepared his heart to seek God -- Jehovah
and Jehovah hearkeneth unto Hezekiah
And the sons of Israel
And Hezekiah speaketh unto the heart of all the Levites
And all the assembly take counsel to keep other seven days
for Hezekiah king of Judah hath presented to the assembly a thousand bullocks
And all the assembly of Judah rejoice
and there is great joy in Jerusalem; for from the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there is not like this in Jerusalem
and the priests
