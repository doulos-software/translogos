A son of twelve years is Manasseh in his reigning
and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
and he turneth and buildeth the high places that Hezekiah his father hath broken down
And he hath built altars in the house of Jehovah of which Jehovah had said
And he buildeth altars to all the host of the heavens in the two courts of the house of Jehovah."
And he hath caused his sons to pass over through fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom
And he placeth the graven image of the idol that he made in the house of God
and I add not to turn aside the foot of Israel from off the ground that I appointed to your fathers
And Manasseh maketh Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err
And Jehovah speaketh unto Manasseh and unto his people
and Jehovah bringeth in against them the heads of the host that the king of Asshur hath
And when he is in distress he hath appeased the face of Jehovah his God
and prayeth unto Him
And after this he hath built an outer wall to the city of David
And he turneth aside the gods of the stranger
And he buildeth the altar of Jehovah
but still the people are sacrificing in high places
And the rest of the matters of Manasseh
and his prayer
And Manasseh lieth with his fathers
A son of twenty and two years `is' Amon in his reigning
and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
and hath not been humbled before Jehovah
And his servants conspire against him
and the people of the land smite all those conspiring against king Amon
