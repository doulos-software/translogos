A son of eight years `is' Josiah in his reigning
and he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah
And in the eighth year of his reign (and he yet a youth)
And they break down before him the altars of the Baalim
and the bones of the priests he hath burnt on their altars
and in the cities of Manasseh
And he breaketh down the altars and the shrines
And in the eighteenth year of his reign
And they come in unto Hilkiah the high priest
and they give `it' into the hand of the workmen
and they give `it' to artificers
And the men are working faithfully in the business
and over the burden-bearers
And in their bringing out the money that is brought in to the house of Jehovah
and Hilkiah answereth and saith unto Shaphan the scribe
and Shaphan bringeth in the book unto the king
and they pour out the money that is found in the house of Jehovah
And Shaphan the scribe declareth to the king
And it cometh to pass
and the king commandeth Hilkiah
`Go
And Hilkiah goeth
And she saith to them
Thus said Jehovah
because that they have forsaken Me
`And unto the king of Judah
Because thy heart `is' tender
Lo
And the king sendeth and gathereth all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem
and the king goeth up to the house of Jehovah
And the king standeth on his station
And he presenteth every one who is found in Jerusalem and Benjamin
And Josiah turneth aside all the abominations out of all the lands that the sons of Israel have
