In the thirty and sixth year of the reign of Asa
And Asa bringeth out silver and gold from the treasures of the house of Jehovah
`A covenant `is' between me and thee
And Ben-Hadad hearkeneth unto king Asa
And it cometh to pass
and Asa the king hath taken all Judah
And at that time hath Hanani the seer come in unto Asa king of Judah
Did not the Cushim and the Lubim become a very great force for multitude
for Jehovah -- His eyes go to and fro in all the earth
And Asa is angry at the seer
And lo
And Asa is diseased -- in the thirty and ninth year of his reign -- in his feet
And Asa lieth with his fathers
and they bury him in `one of' his graves
