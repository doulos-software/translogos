And Jehoshaphat his son reigneth in his stead
and putteth a force in all the fenced cities of Judah
And Jehovah is with Jehoshaphat
for to the God of his father he hath sought
And Jehovah doth establish the kingdom in his hand
and his heart is high in the ways of Jehovah
And in the third year of his reign he hath sent for his heads
and with them the Levites
And they teach in Judah
And here is a fear of Jehovah on all kingdoms of the lands that `are' round about Judah
and of the Philistines they are bringing in to Jehoshaphat a present
And Jehoshaphat is going on and becoming very great
and he hath much work in cities of Judah; and men of war
And these `are' their numbers
And at his hand `is' Jehohanan the head
And at his hand `is' Amasiah son of Zichri
And of Benjamin: mighty of valour
And at his hand `is' Jehozabad
These `are' those serving the king
