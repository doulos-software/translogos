And it cometh to pass
As to the cities that Huram hath given to Solomon
And Solomon goeth to Hamath-Zobah
and he buildeth Tadmor in the wilderness
And he buildeth Beth-Horon the upper
and Baalath
All the people who are left of the Hittite
of their sons who have been left after them in the land
And none of the sons of Israel hath Solomon made servants for his work
and these `are' heads of the officers whom king Solomon hath
And the daughter of Pharaoh hath Solomon brought up from the city of David to the house that he built for her
Then hath Solomon caused to ascend burnt-offerings to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah that he built before the porch
even by the matter of a day in its day
And he establisheth
And they have not turned aside `from' the command of the king concerning the priests and the Levites
And all the work of Solomon is prepared till the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah
Then hath Solomon gone to Ezion-Geber
and Huram sendeth to him
