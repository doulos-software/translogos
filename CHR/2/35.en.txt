And Josiah maketh in Jerusalem a passover to Jehovah
and he stationeth the priests over their charges
and saith to the Levites -- who are teaching all Israel -- who are sanctified to Jehovah
and prepare
and stand in the sanctuary
and slaughter the passover-offering and sanctify yourselves
And Josiah lifteth up to the sons of the people a flock of lambs and young goats
And his heads
and Conaniah
And the service is prepared
and they slaughter the passover-offering
and they turn aside the burnt-offering
And they cook the passover with fire
And afterward they have prepared for themselves
And the singers
And all the service of Jehovah is prepared on that day
And the sons of Israel who are found make the passover at that time
And there hath not been made a passover like it in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet
In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah hath this passover been made."
After all this
and he sendeth unto him messengers
And Josiah hath not turned round his face from him
and the archers shoot at king Josiah
And his servants remove him from the chariot
and Jeremiah lamenteth for Josiah
And the rest of the matters of Josiah
even his matters
