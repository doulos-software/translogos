And at the completion of all this
And Hezekiah appointeth the courses of the priests
And a portion of the king
And he saith to the people
and at the spreading forth of the thing have the sons of Israel multiplied the first-fruit of corn
And the sons of Israel and Judah
in the third month they have begun to lay the foundation of the heaps
And Hezekiah and the heads come in and see the heaps
and Hezekiah inquireth at the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps
and Azariah the head priest
And Hezekiah saith to prepare chambers in the house of Jehovah
and they bring in the heave-offering
and Jehiel
And Kore son of Imnah the Levite
And by his hand `are' Eden
apart from their genealogy
and the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers
and to the genealogy among all their infants
And to sons of Aaron
And Hezekiah doth thus in all Judah
and in every work that he hath begun for the service of the house of God
