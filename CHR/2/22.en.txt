And the inhabitants of Jerusalem cause Ahaziah his youngest son to reign in his stead
A son of twenty and two years `is' Ahaziah in his reigning
he also hath walked in the ways of the house of Ahab
And he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah
Also
and he turneth back to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds with which they had smitten him in Ramah
and from God hath been the destruction of Ahaziah
And it cometh to pass
And he seeketh Ahaziah
And Athaliah mother of Ahaziah hath seen that her son is dead
And Jehoshabeath daughter of the king taketh Joash son of Ahaziah
And he is with them in the house of God hiding himself six years
