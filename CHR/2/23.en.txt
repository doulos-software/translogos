And in the seventh year hath Jehoiada strengthened himself
And they go round about in Judah
and all the assembly make a covenant in the house of God with the king
`This `is' the thing that ye do: The third of you
and the third `are' at the house of the king
`And none doth enter the house of Jehovah except the priests
and the Levites have compassed the king round about
And the Levites and all Judah do according to all that Jehoiada the priest hath commanded
And Jehoiada the priest giveth to the heads of the hundreds the spears
and he stationeth the whole of the people
And they bring out the son of the king
And Athaliah heareth the voice of the people who are running
and seeth
And Jehoiada the priest bringeth out the heads of the hundreds
And they make for her sides
And Jehoiada maketh a covenant between him
and all the people enter the house of Baal
And Jehoiada putteth the offices of the house of Jehovah into the hand of the priests the Levites whom David had apportioned over the house of Jehovah
and he stationeth the gatekeepers over the gates of the house of Jehovah
And he taketh the heads of the hundreds
And all the people of the land rejoice
