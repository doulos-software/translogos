And he maketh an altar of brass
And he maketh the molten sea; ten by the cubit
And the likeness of oxen `is' under it
It is standing on twelve oxen
And its thickness `is' a handbreadth
And he maketh ten lavers
And he maketh the ten candlesticks of gold
And he maketh ten tables
And he maketh the court of the priests
And the sea he hath placed on the right shoulder eastward
And Huram maketh the pots
two pillars
and the pomegranates four hundred to the two wreaths
And the bases he hath made; and the lavers he hath made on the bases;"
the one sea
and the pots
In the circuit of the Jordan hath the king cast them
And Solomon maketh all these vessels in great abundance
And Solomon maketh all the vessels that `are for' the house of God
and the candlesticks
and the flowers
and the snuffers
