And Solomon saith to build a house for the name of Jehovah
and Solomon numbereth seventy thousand men bearing burden
And Solomon sendeth unto Huram king of Tyre
lo
`And the house that I am building `is' great
and who doth retain strength to build to Him a house
`And now
and send to me cedar-trees
even to prepare for me trees in abundance
`And lo
And Huram king of Tyre saith in writing
And Huram saith
`And now
(son of a woman of the daughters of Dan
`And
and we -- we cut trees out of Lebanon
And Solomon numbereth all the men
and he maketh of them seventy thousand burden-bearers
