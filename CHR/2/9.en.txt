And the queen of Sheba hath heard of the fame of Solomon
and Solomon declareth to her all her matters
And the queen of Sheba seeth the wisdom of Solomon
and the food of his table
And she saith unto the king
and I have given no credence to their words
`O the happiness of thy men
Let Jehovah thy God be blessed who hath delighted in thee
And she giveth to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold
And also
And the king maketh the algum-trees staircases for the house of Jehovah
And king Solomon hath given to the queen of Sheba all her desire that she asked
And the weight of the gold that is coming to Solomon in one year is six hundred and sixty and six talents of gold
apart from `what' the tourists
And king Solomon maketh two hundred targets of alloyed gold
and three hundred shields of alloyed gold
And the king maketh a great throne of ivory
and six steps `are' to the throne
and twelve lions are standing there on the six steps on this `side'
And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon `are' of gold
for ships of the king are going to Tarshish
And king Solomon becometh greater than any of the kings of the earth for riches and wisdom;"
and all the kings of the earth are seeking the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom that God hath put in his heart
and they are bringing in each his present
And there are to Solomon four thousand stalls for horses and chariots
And he is ruling over all the kings from the River even unto the land of the Philistines
And the king maketh the silver in Jerusalem as stones
and they are bringing out horses from Egypt to Solomon
And the rest of the matters of Solomon
And Solomon reigneth in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years
and Solomon lieth with his fathers
