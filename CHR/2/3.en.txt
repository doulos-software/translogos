And Solomon beginneth to build the house of Jehovah
and he beginneth to build in the second `day'
And `in' these hath Solomon been instructed to build the house of God: The length `in' cubits by the former measure `is' sixty cubits
As to the porch that `is' on the front
And the large house he hath covered with fir-trees
and he overlayeth the house with precious stone for beauty
and he covereth the house
And he maketh the most holy house: its length `is' by the front of the breadth of the house twenty cubits
and the weight of the nails `is' fifty shekels of gold
And he maketh in the most holy house two cherubs
as to the wings of the cherubs
And the wing of the other cherub `is' five cubits touching the wall of the house
The wings of these cherubs are spreading forth twenty cubits
And he maketh the vail of blue
And he maketh at the front of the house two pillars
And he maketh chains in the oracle
And he raiseth up the pillars on the front of the temple
