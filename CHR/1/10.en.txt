And the Philistines have fought with Israel
and the Philistines pursue after Saul
And the battle `is' heavy on Saul
and Saul saith unto the bearer of his weapons
and the bearer of his weapons seeth that Saul `is' dead
and Saul dieth
And all the men of Israel who `are' in the valley see that they have fled
And it cometh to pass
and strip him
and put his weapons in the house of their gods
And all Jabesh-Gilead hear of all that the Philistines have done to Saul
and all the men of valour rise and bear away the body of Saul
And Saul dieth because of his trespass that he trespassed against Jehovah
and he inquired not at Jehovah
