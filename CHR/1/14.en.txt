And Huram king of Tyre sendeth messengers unto David
And David knoweth that Jehovah hath established him for king over Israel
And David taketh again wives in Jerusalem
and these `are' the names of the children whom he hath in Jerusalem: Shammua
and Ibhar
and Nogah
and Elishama
And the Philistines hear that David hath been anointed for king over all Israel
And the Philistines have come
and David asketh of God
And they go up into Baal-Perazim
And they leave there their gods
And the Philistines add again
and David asketh again of God
and it cometh to pass
And David doth as God commanded him
and the name of David goeth out into all the lands
