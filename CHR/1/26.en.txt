For the courses of the gatekeepers: of the Korhites `is' Meshelemiah son of Kore
and to Meshelemiah `are' sons
Elam the fifth
And to Obed-Edom `are' sons
Ammiel the sixth
And to Shemaiah his son have sons been born
Sons of Shemaiah `are' Othni
all these `are' of the sons of Obed-Edom; they
And to Meshelemiah `are' sons and brethren
and to Hosah
Hilkiah the second
According to these `are' the courses of the gatekeepers; to the heads of the mighty ones `are' charges over-against their brethren
and they cause to fall lots
And the lot falleth eastward to Shelemiah; and `for' Zechariah his son -- a counsellor with understanding -- they cause to fall lots
to Obed-Edom southward
to Shuppim and to Hosah to the west
to the east the Levites `are' six; to the north daily four
at Parbar
These are the courses of the gatekeepers
And of the Levites
Sons of Laadan: sons of the Gershonite
Sons of Jehieli: Zetham
for the Amramite
And Shebuel son of Gershom
And his brethren
This Shelomith and his brethren `are' over all the treasures of the holy things
from the battles
and all that Samuel the seer
Of the Izharite
Of the Hebronite
Of the Hebronite
and his brethren
