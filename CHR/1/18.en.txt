And it cometh to pass after this
and he smiteth Moab
And David smiteth Hadarezer king of Zobah
and David captureth from him a thousand chariots
And Aram of Damascus cometh in to give help to Hadarezer king of Zobah
and David putteth `garrisons' in Aram of Damascus
And David taketh the shields of gold that have been on the servants of Hadarezer
and from Tibhath
And Tou king of Hamath heareth that David hath smitten the whole force of Hadarezer king of Zobah
and he sendeth Hadoram his son unto king David
also them hath king David sanctified to Jehovah with the silver and the gold that he hath taken from all the nations
And Abishai son of Zeruiah hath smitten Edom in the valley of salt -- eighteen thousand
and he putteth in Edom garrisons
And David reigneth over all Israel
and Joab son of Zeruiah `is' over the host
and Zadok son of Ahitub
and Benaiah son of Jehoiada `is' over the Cherethite and the Pelethite
