And it cometh to pass after this
and David saith
and the heads of the sons of Ammon say to Hanun
And Hanun taketh the servants of David
And `some' go
And the sons of Ammon see that they have made themselves abhorred by David
and they hire to them two and thirty thousand chariots
And David heareth
and the sons of Ammon come out and set battle in array at the opening of the city
And Joab seeth that the front of the battle hath been unto him
and the remnant of the people he hath given into the hand of Abishai his brother
And he saith
be strong
And Joab draweth nigh
and the sons of Ammon have seen that Aram hath fled
And Aram seeth that they have been smitten before Israel
And it is declared to David
and Aram fleeth from the face of Israel
And the servants of Hadarezer see that they have been smitten before Israel
