And gathered are all Israel unto David to Hebron
even in time past
And all the elders of Israel come in unto the king to Hebron
And David goeth
And the inhabitants of Jebus say to David
And David saith
And David dwelleth in the fortress
and he buildeth the city round about
And David goeth
And these `are' heads of the mighty ones whom David hath
And this `is' an account of the mighty ones whom David hath: Jashobeam son of a Hachmonite `is' head of the thirty; he is lifting up his spear against three hundred -- wounded
And after him `is' Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite
he hath been with David in Pas-Dammim
and they station themselves in the midst of the portion
And three of the thirty heads go down on the rock unto David
and David `is' then in the fortress
and David longeth
And the three break through the camp of the Philistines
and saith
And Abishai brother of Joab
Of the three by the two he is honoured
Benaiah son of Jehoiada
And he hath smitten the man
These `things' hath Benaiah son of Jehoiada done
Of the thirty
And the mighty ones of the forces `are' Asahel brother of Joab
