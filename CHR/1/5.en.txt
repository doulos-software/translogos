As to sons of Reuben
for Judah hath been mighty over his brother
Sons of Reuben
Sons of Joel: Shemaiah his son
Micah his son
Beerah his son
And his brethren
and Bela son of Azaz
and at the east he dwelt even unto the entering in of the wilderness
And in the days of Saul they have made war with the Hagarites
And the sons of Gad
Joel the head
and their brethren of the house of their fathers `are' Michael
These `are' sons of Abihail son of Huri
Ahi son of Abdiel
and they dwell in Gilead in Bashan
all of them reckoned themselves by genealogy in the days of Jotham king of Judah
Sons of Reuben
And they make war with the Hagarites
and they are helped against them
And they take captive their cattle
for many have fallen pierced
And the sons of the half of the tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land
And these `are' heads of the house of their fathers
And they trespass against the God of their fathers
and stir up doth the God of Israel the spirit of Pul king of Asshur
