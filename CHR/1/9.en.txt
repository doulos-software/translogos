And all Israel have reckoned themselves by genealogy
And the first inhabitants
And in Jerusalem dwelt of the sons of Judah
Uthai son of Ammihud
And of the Shilonite: Asaiah the first-born
And of the sons of Zerah: Jeuel
And of the sons of Benjamin: Sallu son of Meshullam
and Ibneiah son of Jeroham
And their brethren
And of the priests: Jedaiah
and Azariah son of Hilkiah
and Adaiah son of Jeroham
And their brethren
And of the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hashshub
and Bakbakkar
and Obadiah son of Shemariah
And the gatekeepers `are' Shallum
and hitherto they `are' at the gate of the king eastward; they `are' the gatekeepers for the companies of the sons of Levi."
And Shallum son of Kore
and Phinehas son of Eleazar hath been leader over them formerly; Jehovah `is' with him."
Zechariah son of Meshelemiah `is' gatekeeper at the opening of the tent of meeting."
All of those who are chosen for gatekeepers at the thresholds `are' two hundred and twelve; they `are' in their villages
And they and their sons `are' over the gates of the house of Jehovah
At four sides are the gatekeepers
And their brethren in their villages `are' to come in for seven days from time to time with these."
For in office `are' the four chiefs of the gatekeepers
and round about the house of God they lodge
And `some' of them `are' over the vessels of service
And `some' of them are appointed over the vessels
And `some' of the sons of the priests are mixing the mixture for spices."
And Mattithiah
And of the sons of the Kohathite
And these who sing
These heads of the fathers of the Levites throughout their generations `are' heads. These have dwelt in Jerusalem."
And in Gibeon dwelt hath the father of Gibeon
and his son
and Gedor
And Mikloth begat Shimeam
And Ner begat Kish
And a son of Jonathan `is' Merib-Baal
And sons of Micah: Pithon
and Ahaz -- he begat Jaarah
and Moza begat Binea
And to Azel `are' six sons
