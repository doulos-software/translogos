And they bring in the ark of God
and David ceaseth from offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings
and giveth a portion to every man of Israel
And he putteth before the ark of Jehovah
Asaph the head
and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests `are' with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God."
On that day then hath David given at the beginning to give thanks to Jehovah by the hand of Asaph and his brethren: --"
Give thanks to Jehovah
Sing ye to Him
Boast yourselves in His holy name
Seek ye Jehovah and His strength
Remember His wonders that He did
O seed of Israel
He `is' Jehovah our God
Remember ye to the age His covenant
Which He hath made with Abraham
And He establisheth it to Jacob for a statute
Saying: To thee I give the land of Canaan
When ye are few of number
And they go up and down
He hath not suffered any to oppress them
Come not against Mine anointed ones
Sing to Jehovah
Rehearse among nations His glory
For great `is' Jehovah
For all gods of the peoples `are' nought
Honour and majesty `are' before Him
Ascribe to Jehovah
Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name
Be pained before Him
Also
Roar doth the sea
Then sing do trees of the forest
Give thanks to Jehovah
And say
Blessed `is' Jehovah
And he leaveth there before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah
both Obed-Edom and their brethren
and Zadok the priest
to cause to ascend burnt-offerings to Jehovah
And with them `are' Heman and Jeduthun
and with them -- Heman and Jeduthun -- `are' trumpets and cymbals for those sounding
And all the people go
