And these `are' those coming in unto David to Ziklag
armed with bow
The head `is' Ahiezer
and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite
Eluzai
Elkanah
and Joelah
And of the Gadite there have been separated unto David
Ezer the head
Mishmannah the fourth
Attai the sixth
Johanan the eighth
Jeremiah the tenth
These `are' of the sons of Gad
these `are' they who have passed over the Jordan in the first month
And there come of the sons of Benjamin and Judah unto the stronghold to David
and David goeth out before them
And the Spirit hath clothed Amasai
And of Manasseh there have fallen unto David in his coming with the Philistines against Israel to battle -- and they helped them not
In his going unto Ziglag there have fallen unto him of Manasseh
and they have helped with David over the troop
for at that time
And these `are' the numbers of the head
The sons of Judah
Of the sons of Simeon
Of the sons of Levi `are' four thousand and six hundred;"
and Jehoiada `is' the leader of the Aaronite
and Zadok
And of the sons of Benjamin
And of the sons of Ephraim `are' twenty thousand and eight hundred
And of the half of the tribe of Manasseh `are' eighteen thousand
And of the sons of Issachar
Of Zebulun
And of Naphtali
And of the Danite
And of Asher
And from beyond the Jordan
All these `are' men of war
and they are there
And also those near unto them
