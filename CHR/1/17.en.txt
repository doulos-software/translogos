And it cometh to pass as David sat in his house
and Nathan saith unto David
And it cometh to pass on that night that a word of God is unto Nathan
`Go
for I have not dwelt in a house from the day that I brought up Israel till this day
whithersoever I have walked up and down among all Israel
`And now
and I am with thee whithersoever thou hast walked
`And I have prepared a place for My people Israel
yea
and it hath come to pass
he doth build for Me a house
I am to him for a father
and I have established him in My house
According to all these words
And David the king cometh in and sitteth before Jehovah
And this is small in Thine eyes
`What doth David add more unto Thee for the honour of Thy servant; and Thou Thy servant hast known."
O Jehovah
O Jehovah
`And who `is' as Thy people Israel
Yea
`And now
and let it be stedfast
for Thou
`And now
and now
