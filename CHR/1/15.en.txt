And he maketh for himself houses in the city of David
Then said David
And David assembleth all Israel unto Jerusalem
And David gathereth the sons of Aaron
Of sons of Kohath: Uriel the chief
Of sons of Merari: Asaiah the chief
Of sons of Gershom: Joel the chief
Of sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the chief
Of sons of Hebron: Eliel the chief
Of sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the chief
And David calleth to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests
and saith to them
because at the first `it was' not ye
And the priests and the Levites sanctify themselves
and sons of the Levites bear the ark of God
And David saith to the heads of the Levites to appoint their brethren the singers
And the Levites appoint Heman son of Joel
and with them their brethren
and the singers
and Zechariah
and Mattithiah
And Chenaniah
And Berechiah and Elkanah `are' gatekeepers for the ark."
And Shebaniah
And it is David
and it cometh to pass
And David is wrapped in an upper robe of fine linen
And all Israel are bringing up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting
and it cometh to pass
