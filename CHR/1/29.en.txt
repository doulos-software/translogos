And David the king saith to all the assembly
and with all my power I have prepared for the house of my God
`And again
three thousand talents of gold
even gold for `things of' gold
And the heads of the fathers
And they give for the service of the house of God
and he with whom stones are found hath given to the treasury of the house of Jehovah
And the people rejoice because of their offering willingly
And David blesseth Jehovah before the eyes of all the assembly
To Thee
and the riches
`And now
yea
for sojourners we `are' before Thee
`O Jehovah our God
`And I have known
`O Jehovah
and to Solomon my son give a perfect heart
And David saith to all the assembly
And they sacrifice to Jehovah sacrifices
And they eat and drink before Jehovah on that day with great joy
And Solomon sitteth on the throne of Jehovah for king instead of David his father
and all the heads
and Jehovah maketh Solomon exceedingly great before the eyes of all Israel
And David son of Jesse hath reigned over all Israel
and the days that he hath reigned over Israel `are' forty years; in Hebron he reigned seven years
and he dieth in a good old age
And the matters of David the king
with all his reign
