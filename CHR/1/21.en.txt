And there standeth up an adversary against Israel
And David saith unto Joab
And Joab saith
And the word of the king `is' severe against Joab
And Joab giveth the account of the numbering of the people unto David
And Levi and Benjamin he hath not numbered in their midst
And it is evil in the eyes of God concerning this thing
and David saith unto God
And Jehovah speaketh unto Gad
`Go
And Gad cometh in unto David
either for three years -- famine
And David saith unto Gad
And Jehovah giveth a pestilence in Israel
and God sendeth a messenger to Jerusalem to destroy it
and David lifteth up his eyes
And David saith unto God
And the messenger of Jehovah spake unto Gad
And David goeth up by the word of Gad
And Ornan turneth back
And David cometh in unto Ornan
And David saith unto Ornan
And Ornan saith unto David
And king David saith to Ornan
And David giveth to Ornan for the place shekels of gold `in' weight six hundred;"
and David buildeth there an altar to Jehovah
And Jehovah saith to the messenger
At that time when David seeth that Jehovah hath answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite
and the tabernacle of Jehovah that Moses made in the wilderness
and David is not able to go before it to seek God
