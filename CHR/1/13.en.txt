And David consulteth with the heads of the thousands
and David saith to all the assembly of Israel
and we bring round the ark of our God unto us
And all the assembly say to do so
And David assembleth all Israel from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering in of Hamath
and David goeth up
And they place the ark of God on a new cart
and David and all Israel are playing before God
And they come in unto the threshing-floor of Chidon
and the anger of Jehovah is kindled against Uzza
And it is displeasing to David
And David feareth God on that day
And David hath not turned aside the ark unto himself
And the ark of God dwelleth with the household of Obed-Edom
