And David saith
And David saith to gather the sojourners who `are' in the land of Israel
And iron in abundance for nails for leaves of the gates
And cedar-trees even without number
And David saith
And he calleth for Solomon his son
and David saith to Solomon his son
and the word of Jehovah `is' against me
`Lo
he doth build a house to My name
`Now
Only
then thou dost prosper
`And lo
`And with thee in abundance `are' workmen
To the gold
And David giveth charge to all heads of Israel to give help to Solomon his son
`Is not Jehovah your God with you? yea
`Now
