And David is old
and gathereth all the heads of Israel
and the Levites are numbered from a son of thirty years and upward
Of these to preside over the work of the house of Jehovah `are' twenty and four thousand
and four thousand gatekeepers
And David distributeth them into courses: Of the sons of Levi: of Gershon
Of the Gershonite: Laadan and Shimei."
Sons of Laadan: the head `is' Jehiel
Sons of Shimei `are' Shelomith
And sons of Shimei `are' Jahath
And Jahath is the head
Sons of Kohath `are' Amram
Sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron is separated for his sanctifying the holy of holies
As to Moses
Sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer."
Sons of Gershom: Shebuel the head."
And sons of Eliezer are Rehabiah the head
Sons of Izhar: Shelomith the head."
Sons of Hebron: Jeriah the head
Sons of Uzziel: Micah the head
Sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi; sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish."
And Eleazar dieth
Sons of Mushi: Mahli
These `are' sons of Levi
for David said
and also of the Levites
for by the last words of David they `took' the number of the sons of Levi from a son of twenty years and upward
for their station `is' at the side of the sons of Aaron
and for the bread of the arrangement
and to stand
and for all the burnt-offerings -- burnt-offerings to Jehovah for sabbaths
And they have kept the charge of the tent of meeting
