The wicked have fled and there is no pursuer. And the righteous as a young lion is confident."
By the transgression of a land many `are' its heads. And by an intelligent man
A man -- poor and oppressing the weak
Those forsaking the law praise the wicked
Evil men understand not judgment
Better `is' the poor walking in his integrity
Whoso is keeping the law is an intelligent son
Whoso is multiplying his wealth by biting and usury
Whoso is turning his ear from hearing the law
Whoso is causing the upright to err in an evil way
A rich man is wise in his own eyes
In the exulting of the righteous the glory `is' abundant
Whoso is covering his transgressions prospereth not
O the happiness of a man fearing continually
A growling lion
A leader lacking understanding multiplieth oppressions
A man oppressed with the blood of a soul
Whoso is walking uprightly is saved
Whoso is tilling his ground is satisfied `with' bread
A stedfast man hath multiplied blessings
To discern faces is not good
Troubled for wealth `is' the man `with' an evil eye
Whoso is reproving a man afterwards findeth grace
Whoso is robbing his father
Whoso is proud in soul stirreth up contention
Whoso is trusting in his heart is a fool
Whoso is giving to the poor hath no lack
In the rising of the wicked a man is hidden
