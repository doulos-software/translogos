As snow in summer
As a bird by wandering
A whip is for a horse
Answer not a fool according to his folly
Answer a fool according to his folly
He is cutting off feet
Weak have been the two legs of the lame
As one who is binding a stone in a sling
A thorn hath gone up into the hand of a drunkard
Great `is' the Former of all
As a dog hath returned to its vomit
Thou hast seen a man wise in his own eyes
The slothful hath said
The door turneth round on its hinge
The slothful hath hid his hand in a dish
Wiser `is' the slothful in his own eyes
Laying hold on the ears of a dog
As `one' pretending to be feeble
So hath a man deceived his neighbour
Without wood is fire going out
Coal to burning coals
The words of a tale-bearer `are' as self-inflicted wounds
Silver of dross spread over potsherd
By his lips doth a hater dissemble
When his voice is gracious trust not in him
Hatred is covered by deceit
Whoso is digging a pit falleth into it
A lying tongue hateth its bruised ones
