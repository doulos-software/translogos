A name is chosen rather than much wealth
Rich and poor have met together
The prudent hath seen the evil
The end of humility `is' the fear of Jehovah
Thorns -- snares `are' in the way of the perverse
Give instruction to a youth about his way
The rich over the poor ruleth
Whoso is sowing perverseness reapeth sorrow
The good of eye -- he is blessed
Cast out a scorner -- and contention goeth out
Whoso is loving cleanness of heart
The eyes of Jehovah have kept knowledge
The slothful hath said
A deep pit `is' the mouth of strange women
Folly is bound up in the heart of a youth
He is oppressing the poor to multiply to him
Incline thine ear
For they are pleasant when thou dost keep them in thy heart
That thy trust may be in Jehovah
Have I not written to thee three times With counsels and knowledge?"
To cause thee to know the certainty of sayings of truth
Rob not the poor because he `is' poor
For Jehovah pleadeth their cause
Shew not thyself friendly with an angry man
Lest thou learn his paths
Be not thou among those striking hands
If thou hast nothing to pay
Remove not a border of olden times
Hast thou seen a man speedy in his business? Before kings he doth station himself
