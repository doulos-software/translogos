Rivulets of waters `is' the heart of a king in the hand of Jehovah
Every way of a man `is' right in his own eyes
To do righteousness and judgment
Loftiness of eyes
The purposes of the diligent `are' only to advantage
The making of treasures by a lying tongue
The spoil of the wicked catcheth them
Froward `is' the way of a man who is vile
Better to sit on a corner of the roof
The soul of the wicked hath desired evil
When the scorner is punished
The Righteous One is acting wisely Towards the house of the wicked
Whoso is shutting his ear from the cry of the poor
A gift in secret pacifieth anger
To do justice `is' joy to the righteous
A man who is wandering from the way of understanding
Whoso `is' loving mirth `is' a poor man
The wicked `is' an atonement for the righteous
Better to dwell in a wilderness land
A treasure to be desired
Whoso is pursuing righteousness and kindness
A city of the mighty hath the wise gone up
Whoso is keeping his mouth and his tongue
Proud
The desire of the slothful slayeth him
All the day desiring he hath desired
The sacrifice of the wicked `is' abomination
A false witness doth perish
A wicked man hath hardened by his face
There is no wisdom
A horse is prepared for a day of battle
