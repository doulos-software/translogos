When thou sittest to eat with a ruler
And thou hast put a knife to thy throat
Have no desire to his dainties
Labour not to make wealth
For wealth maketh to itself wings
Eat not the bread of an evil eye
For as he hath thought in his soul
Thy morsel thou hast eaten thou dost vomit up
In the ears of a fool speak not
Remove not a border of olden times
For their Redeemer `is' strong
Bring in to instruction thy heart
Withhold not from a youth chastisement
Thou with a rod smitest him
My son
And my reins exult when thy lips speak uprightly."
Let not thy heart be envious at sinners
For
Hear thou
Be not thou among quaffers of wine
For the quaffer and glutton become poor
Hearken to thy father
Truth buy
The father of the righteous rejoiceth greatly
Rejoice doth thy father and thy mother
Give
For a harlot `is' a deep ditch
She also
Who hath wo? who hath sorrow? Who hath contentions? who hath plaint? Who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes?"
Those tarrying by the wine
See not wine when it showeth itself red
Its latter end -- as a serpent it biteth
Thine eyes see strange women
And thou hast been as one lying down in the heart of the sea
`They smote me
