Hear
For good learning I have given to you
For
And he directeth me
Get wisdom
Forsake her not
The first thing `is' wisdom -- get wisdom
Exalt her
She giveth to thy head a wreath of grace
Hear
In a way of wisdom I have directed thee
In thy walking thy step is not straitened
Lay hold on instruction
Into the path of the wicked enter not
Avoid it
For they sleep not if they do not evil
For they have eaten bread of wickedness
And the path of the righteous `is' as a shining light
The way of the wicked `is' as darkness
My son
Let them not turn aside from thine eyes
For life they `are' to those finding them
Above every charge keep thy heart
Turn aside from thee a froward mouth
Thine eyes do look straightforward
Ponder thou the path of thy feet
Incline not `to' the right or to the left
