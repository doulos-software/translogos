Words of a Gatherer
For I am more brutish than any one
Nor have I learned wisdom
Who went up to heaven
Every saying of God `is' tried
Add not to His words
Two things I have asked from Thee
Vanity and a lying word put far from me
Lest I become satiated
Accuse not a servant unto his lord
A generation `is'
A generation -- pure in their own eyes
A generation -- how high are their eyes
A generation -- swords `are' their teeth
To the leech `are' two daughters
Sheol
An eye that mocketh at a father
Three things have been too wonderful for me
The way of the eagle in the heavens
So -- the way of an adulterous woman
For three things hath earth been troubled
For a servant when he reigneth
For a hated one when she ruleth
Four `are' little ones of earth
The ants `are' a people not strong
Conies `are' a people not strong
A king there is not to the locust
A spider with two hands taketh hold
Three there are going well
An old lion -- mighty among beasts
A girt one of the loins
If thou hast been foolish in lifting up thyself
For the churning of milk bringeth out butter
