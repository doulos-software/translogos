Boast not thyself of to-morrow
Let another praise thee
A stone `is' heavy
Fury `is' fierce
Better `is' open reproof than hidden love."
Faithful are the wounds of a lover
A satiated soul treadeth down a honeycomb
As a bird wandering from her nest
Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart
Thine own friend
Be wise
The prudent hath seen the evil
Take his garment
Whoso is saluting his friend with a loud voice
A continual dropping in a day of rain
Whoso is hiding her hath hidden the wind
Iron by iron is sharpened
The keeper of a fig-tree eateth its fruit
As `in' water the face `is' to face
Sheol and destruction are not satisfied
A refining pot `is' for silver
If thou dost beat the foolish in a mortar
Know well the face of thy flock
For riches `are' not to the age
Revealed was the hay
Lambs `are' for thy clothing
And a sufficiency of goats' milk `is' for thy bread
