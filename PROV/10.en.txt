Proverbs of Solomon. A wise son causeth a father to rejoice
Treasures of wickedness profit not
Jehovah causeth not the soul of the righteous to hunger
Poor `is' he who is working -- a slothful hand
Whoso is gathering in summer `is' a wise son
Blessings `are' for the head of the righteous
The remembrance of the righteous `is' for a blessing
The wise in heart accepteth commands
Whoso is walking in integrity walketh confidently
Whoso is winking the eye giveth grief
A fountain of life `is' the mouth of the righteous
Hatred awaketh contentions
In the lips of the intelligent is wisdom found
The wise lay up knowledge
The wealth of the rich `is' his strong city
The wage of the righteous `is' for life
A traveller to life `is' he who is keeping instruction
Whoso is covering hatred with lying lips
In the abundance of words transgression ceaseth not
The tongue of the righteous `is' chosen silver
The lips of the righteous delight many
The blessing of Jehovah -- it maketh rich
To execute inventions `is' as play to a fool
The feared thing of the wicked it meeteth him
As the passing by of a hurricane
As vinegar to the teeth
The fear of Jehovah addeth days
The hope of the righteous `is' joyful
The way of Jehovah `is' strength to the perfect
The righteous to the age is not moved
The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom
The lips of the righteous know a pleasing thing
