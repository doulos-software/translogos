My son
To cause thine ear to attend to wisdom
For
If thou dost seek her as silver
Then understandest thou fear of Jehovah
For Jehovah giveth wisdom
Even to lay up for the upright substance
To keep the paths of judgment
Then understandest thou righteousness
For wisdom cometh into thy heart
Thoughtfulness doth watch over thee
To deliver thee from an evil way
Who are forsaking paths of uprightness
Who are rejoicing to do evil
Whose paths `are' crooked
To deliver thee from the strange woman
Who is forsaking the guide of her youth
For her house hath inclined unto death
None going in unto her turn back
That thou dost go in the way of the good
For the upright do inhabit the earth
And the wicked from the earth are cut off
