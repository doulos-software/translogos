Every wise woman hath builded her house
Whoso is walking in his uprightness is fearing Jehovah
In the mouth of a fool `is' a rod of pride
Without oxen a stall `is' clean
A faithful witness lieth not
A scorner hath sought wisdom
Go from before a foolish man
The wisdom of the prudent `is' to understand his way
Fools mock at a guilt-offering
The heart knoweth its own bitterness
The house of the wicked is destroyed
There is a way -- right before a man
Even in laughter is the heart pained
From his ways is the backslider in heart filled
The simple giveth credence to everything
The wise is fearing and turning from evil
Whoso is short of temper doth folly
The simple have inherited folly
The evil have bowed down before the good
Even of his neighbour is the poor hated
Whoso is despising his neighbour sinneth
Do not they err who are devising evil? And kindness and truth `are' to those devising good
In all labour there is advantage
The crown of the wise is their wealth
A true witness is delivering souls
In the fear of Jehovah `is' strong confidence
The fear of Jehovah `is' a fountain of life
In the multitude of a people `is' the honour of a king
Whoso is slow to anger `is' of great understanding
A healed heart `is' life to the flesh
An oppressor of the poor reproacheth his Maker
In his wickedness is the wicked driven away
In the heart of the intelligent wisdom doth rest. And in the midst of fools it is known."
Righteousness exalteth a nation
The favour of a king `is' to a wise servant
