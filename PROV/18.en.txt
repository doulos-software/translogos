For `an object of' desire he who is separated doth seek
A fool delighteth not in understanding
With the coming of the wicked come also hath contempt
Deep waters `are' the words of a man's mouth
Acceptance of the face of the wicked `is' not good
The lips of a fool enter into strife
The mouth of a fool `is' ruin to him
The words of a tale-bearer `are' as self-inflicted wounds
He also that is remiss in his work
A tower of strength `is' the name of Jehovah
The wealth of the rich `is' the city of his strength
Before destruction the heart of man is high
Whoso is answering a matter before he heareth
The spirit of a man sustaineth his sickness
The heart of the intelligent getteth knowledge
The gift of a man maketh room for him
Righteous `is' the first in his own cause
The lot causeth contentions to cease
A brother transgressed against is as a strong city
From the fruit of a man's mouth is his belly satisfied
Death and life `are' in the power of the tongue
`Whoso' hath found a wife hath found good
`With' supplications doth the poor speak
A man with friends `is' to show himself friendly
