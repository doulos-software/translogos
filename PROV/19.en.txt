Better `is' the poor walking in his integrity
Also
The folly of man perverteth his way
Wealth addeth many friends
A false witness is not acquitted
Many entreat the face of the noble
All the brethren of the poor have hated him
Whoso is getting heart is loving his soul
A false witness is not acquitted
Luxury is not comely for a fool
The wisdom of a man hath deferred his anger
The wrath of a king `is' a growl as of a young lion
A calamity to his father `is' a foolish son
House and wealth `are' the inheritance of fathers
Sloth causeth deep sleep to fall
Whoso is keeping the command is keeping his soul
Whoso is lending `to' Jehovah is favouring the poor
Chastise thy son
A man of great wrath is bearing punishment
Hear counsel and receive instruction
Many `are' the purposes in a man's heart
The desirableness of a man `is' his kindness
The fear of Jehovah `is' to life
The slothful hath hidden his hand in a dish
A scorner smite
Whoso is spoiling a father causeth a mother to flee
Cease
A worthless witness scorneth judgment
Judgments have been prepared for scorners
