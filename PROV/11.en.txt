Balances of deceit `are' an abomination to Jehovah
Pride hath come
The integrity of the upright leadeth them
Wealth profiteth not in a day of wrath
The righteousness of the perfect maketh right his way
The righteousness of the upright delivereth them
In the death of a wicked man
The righteous from distress is drawn out
With the mouth a hypocrite corrupteth his friend
In the good of the righteous a city exulteth
By the blessing of the upright is a city exalted
Whoso is despising his neighbour lacketh heart
A busybody is revealing secret counsel
Without counsels do a people fall
Evil `one' suffereth when he hath been surety `for' a stranger
A gracious woman retaineth honour
A kind man is rewarding his own soul
The wicked is getting a lying wage
Rightly `is' righteousness for life
An abomination to Jehovah `are' the perverse of heart
Hand to hand
A ring of gold in the nose of a sow -- A fair woman and stubborn of behaviour."
The desire of the righteous `is' only good
There is who is scattering
A liberal soul is made fat
Whoso is withholding corn
Whoso is earnestly seeking good Seeketh a pleasing thing
Whoso is confident in his wealth he falleth
Whoso is troubling his own house inheriteth wind
The fruit of the righteous `is' a tree of life
Lo
