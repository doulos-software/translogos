A man often reproved
In the multiplying of the righteous the people rejoice
A man loving wisdom rejoiceth his father
A king by judgment establisheth a land
A man taking a portion above his neighbour
In the transgression of the evil `is' a snare
The righteous knoweth the plea of the poor
Men of scorning ensnare a city
A wise man is judged by the foolish man
Men of blood hate the perfect
A fool bringeth out all his mind
A ruler who is attending to lying words
The poor and the man of frauds have met together
a king that is judging truly the poor
A rod and reproof give wisdom
In the multiplying of the wicked transgression multiplieth
Chastise thy son
Without a Vision is a people made naked
By words a servant is not instructed though he understand
Thou hast seen a man hasty in his words! More hope of a fool than of him."
Whoso is bringing up his servant delicately
An angry man stirreth up contention
The pride of man humbleth him
Whoso is sharing with a thief is hating his own soul
Fear of man causeth a snare
Many are seeking the face of a ruler
An abomination to the righteous `is' the perverse man
