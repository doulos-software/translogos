Better `is' a dry morsel
A wise servant ruleth over a son causing shame
A refining pot `is' for silver
An evil doer is attentive to lips of vanity
Whoso is mocking at the poor Hath reproached his Maker
Sons' sons `are' the crown of old men
Not comely for a fool is a lip of excellency
A stone of grace `is' the bribe in the eyes of its possessors
Whoso is covering transgression is seeking love
Rebuke cometh down on the intelligent More than a hundred stripes on a fool."
An evil man seeketh only rebellion
The meeting of a bereaved bear by a man
Whoso is returning evil for good
The beginning of contention `is' a letting out of waters
Whoso is justifying the wicked
Why `is' this -- a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom
At all times is the friend loving
A man lacking heart is striking hands
Whoso is loving transgression is loving debate
The perverse of heart findeth not good
Whoso is begetting a fool hath affliction for it
A rejoicing heart doth good to the body
A bribe from the bosom the wicked taketh
The face of the intelligent `is' to wisdom
A provocation to his father `is' a foolish son
Also
One acquainted with knowledge is sparing his words
Even a fool keeping silence is reckoned wise
