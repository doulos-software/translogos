My son! if thou hast been surety for thy friend
Hast been snared with sayings of thy mouth
Do this now
Give not sleep to thine eyes
Be delivered as a roe from the hand
Go unto the ant
Which hath not captain
She doth prepare in summer her bread
Till when
A little sleep
And thy poverty hath come as a traveller
A man of worthlessness
Winking with his eyes
Frowardness `is' in his heart
Therefore suddenly cometh his calamity
These six hath Jehovah hated
Eyes high -- tongues false -- And hands shedding innocent blood --"
A heart devising thoughts of vanity -- Feet hasting to run to evil --"
A false witness `who' doth breathe out lies -- And one sending forth contentions between brethren."
Keep
Bind them on thy heart continually
In thy going up and down
For a lamp `is' the command
To preserve thee from an evil woman
Desire not her beauty in thy heart
For a harlot consumeth unto a cake of bread
Doth a man take fire into his bosom
Doth a man walk on the hot coals
So `is' he who hath gone in unto the wife of his neighbour
They do not despise the thief
And being found he repayeth sevenfold
He who committeth adultery `with' a woman lacketh heart
A stroke and shame he doth find
For jealousy `is' the fury of a man
He accepteth not the appearance of any atonement
