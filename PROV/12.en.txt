Whoso is loving instruction
The good bringeth forth favour from Jehovah
A man is not established by wickedness
A virtuous woman `is' a crown to her husband
The thoughts of the righteous `are' justice
The words of the wicked `are': `Lay wait for blood
Overthrow the wicked
According to his wisdom is a man praised
Better `is' the lightly esteemed who hath a servant
The righteous knoweth the life of his beast
Whoso is tilling the ground is satisfied `with' bread
The wicked hath desired the net of evil doers
In transgression of the lips `is' the snare of the wicked
From the fruit of the mouth `is' one satisfied `with' good
The way of a fool `is' right in his own eyes
The fool -- in a day is his anger known
Whoso uttereth faithfulness declareth righteousness
A rash speaker is like piercings of a sword
The lip of truth is established for ever
Deceit `is' in the heart of those devising evil
No iniquity is desired by the righteous
An abomination to Jehovah `are' lying lips
A prudent man is concealing knowledge
The hand of the diligent ruleth
Sorrow in the heart of a man boweth down
The righteous searcheth his companion
The slothful roasteth not his hunting
In the path of righteousness `is' life
