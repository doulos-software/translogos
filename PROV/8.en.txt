Doth not wisdom call? And understanding give forth her voice?"
At the head of high places by the way
At the side of the gates
`Unto you
Understand
Hearken
For truth doth my mouth utter
In righteousness `are' all the sayings of my mouth
All of them `are' plain to the intelligent
Receive my instruction
For better `is' wisdom than rubies
I
The fear of Jehovah `is' to hate evil; Pride
Mine `is' counsel and substance
By me kings reign
By me do chiefs rule
I love those loving me
Wealth and honour `are' with me
Better `is' my fruit than gold
In a path of righteousness I cause to walk
To cause my lovers to inherit substance
Jehovah possessed me -- the beginning of His way
From the age I was anointed
In there being no depths
Before mountains were sunk
While He had not made the earth
In His preparing the heavens I `am' there
In His strengthening clouds above
In His setting for the sea its limit
Then I am near Him
Rejoicing in the habitable part of His earth
And now
Hear instruction
O the happiness of the man hearkening to me
For whoso is finding me
And whoso is missing me
