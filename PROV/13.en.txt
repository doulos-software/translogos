A wise son -- the instruction of a father
From the fruit of the mouth a man eateth good
Whoso is keeping his mouth
The soul of the slothful is desiring
A false word the righteous hateth
Righteousness keepeth him who is perfect in the way
There is who is making himself rich
The ransom of a man's life `are' his riches
The light of the righteous rejoiceth
A vain man through pride causeth debate
Wealth from vanity becometh little
Hope prolonged is making the heart sick
Whoso is despising the Word is destroyed for it
The law of the wise `is' a fountain of life
Good understanding giveth grace
Every prudent one dealeth with knowledge
A wicked messenger falleth into evil
Whoso is refusing instruction -- poverty and shame
A desire accomplished is sweet to the soul
Whoso is walking with wise men is wise
Evil pursueth sinners
A good man causeth sons' sons to inherit
Abundance of food -- the tillage of the poor
Whoso is sparing his rod is hating his son
The righteous is eating to the satiety of his soul
