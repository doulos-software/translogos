Wine `is' a scorner -- strong drink `is' noisy
The fear of a king `is' a growl as of a young lion
An honour to a man is cessation from strife
Because of winter the slothful plougheth not
Counsel in the heart of a man `is' deep water
A multitude of men proclaim each his kindness
The righteous is walking habitually in his integrity
A king sitting on a throne of judgment
Who saith
A stone and a stone
Even by his actions a youth maketh himself known
A hearing ear
Love not sleep
`Bad
Substance
Take his garment when a stranger hath been surety
Sweet to a man `is' the bread of falsehood
Purposes by counsel thou dost establish
A revealer of secret counsels is the busybody
Whoso is vilifying his father and his mother
An inheritance gotten wrongly at first
Do not say
An abomination to Jehovah `are' a stone and a stone
From Jehovah `are' the steps of a man
A snare to a man `is' he hath swallowed a holy thing
A wise king is scattering the wicked
The breath of man `is' a lamp of Jehovah
Kindness and truth keep a king
The beauty of young men is their strength
The bandages of a wound thou removest with the evil
