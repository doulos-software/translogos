My son! my law forget not
For length of days and years
Let not kindness and truth forsake thee
And find grace and good understanding In the eyes of God and man."
Trust unto Jehovah with all thy heart
In all thy ways know thou Him
Be not wise in thine own eyes
Healing it is to thy navel
Honour Jehovah from thy substance
And filled are thy barns `with' plenty
Chastisement of Jehovah
For whom Jehovah loveth He reproveth
O the happiness of a man `who' hath found wisdom
For better `is' her merchandise Than the merchandise of silver
Precious she `is' above rubies
Length of days `is' in her right hand
Her ways `are' ways of pleasantness
A tree of life she `is' to those laying hold on her
Jehovah by wisdom did found the earth
By His knowledge depths have been rent
My son! let them not turn from thine eyes
And they are life to thy soul
Then thou goest thy way confidently
If thou liest down
Be not afraid of sudden fear
For Jehovah is at thy side
Withhold not good from its owners
Say not thou to thy friend
Devise not against thy neighbour evil
Strive not with a man without cause
Be not envious of a man of violence
For an abomination to Jehovah `is' the perverted
The curse of Jehovah `is' in the house of the wicked. And the habitation of the righteous He blesseth."
If the scorners He doth scorn
Honour do the wise inherit
