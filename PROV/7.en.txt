My son! keep my sayings
Keep my commands
Bind them on thy fingers
Say to wisdom
To preserve thee from a strange woman
For
And I do see among the simple ones
Passing on in the street
In the twilight -- in the evening of day
And
Noisy she `is'
Now in an out-place
And she laid hold on him
`Sacrifices of peace-offerings `are' by me
Therefore I have come forth to meet thee
`With' ornamental coverings I decked my couch
I sprinkled my bed -- myrrh
Come
For the man is not in his house
A bag of money he hath taken in his hand
She turneth him aside with the abundance of her speech
He is going after her straightway
Till an arrow doth split his liver
And now
Let not thy heart turn unto her ways
For many `are' the wounded she caused to fall
The ways of Sheol -- her house
