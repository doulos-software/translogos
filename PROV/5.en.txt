My son! to my wisdom give attention
To observe thoughtfulness
For the lips of a strange woman drop honey
And her latter end `is' bitter as wormwood
Her feet are going down to death
The path of life -- lest thou ponder
And now
Keep far from off her thy way
Lest thou give to others thy honour
Lest strangers be filled `with' thy power
And thou hast howled in thy latter end
And hast said
And I have not hearkened to the voice of my directors
As a little thing I have been all evil
Drink waters out of thine own cistern
Let thy fountains be scattered abroad
Let them be to thee for thyself
Let thy fountain be blessed
A hind of loves
And why dost thou magnify thyself
For over-against the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of each
His own iniquities do capture the wicked
He dieth without instruction
