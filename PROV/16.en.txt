Of man `are' arrangements of the heart
All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes
Roll unto Jehovah thy works
All things hath Jehovah wrought for Himself
An abomination to Jehovah `is' every proud one of heart
In kindness and truth pardoned is iniquity
When a man's ways please Jehovah
Better `is' a little with righteousness
The heart of man deviseth his way
An oath `is' on the lips of a king
A just beam and balances `are' Jehovah's
An abomination to kings `is' doing wickedness
The delight of kings `are' righteous lips
The fury of a king `is' messengers of death
In the light of a king's face `is' life
To get wisdom -- how much better than gold
A highway of the upright `is'
Before destruction `is' pride
Better is humility of spirit with the poor
The wise in any matter findeth good
To the wise in heart is called
A fountain of life `is' understanding to its possessors
The heart of the wise causeth his mouth to act wisely
Sayings of pleasantness `are' a honeycomb
There is a way right before a man
A labouring man hath laboured for himself
A worthless man is preparing evil
A froward man sendeth forth contention
A violent man enticeth his neighbour
Consulting his eyes to devise froward things
A crown of beauty `are' grey hairs
Better `is' the slow to anger than the mighty
Into the centre is the lot cast
