A soft answer turneth back fury
The tongue of the wise maketh knowledge good
In every place are the eyes of Jehovah
A healed tongue `is' a tree of life
A fool despiseth the instruction of his father
`In' the house of the righteous `is' abundant strength
The lips of the wise scatter knowledge
The sacrifice of the wicked `is' an abomination to Jehovah
An abomination to Jehovah `is' the way of the wicked
Chastisement `is' grievous to him who is forsaking the path
Sheol and destruction `are' before Jehovah
A scorner loveth not his reprover
A joyful heart maketh glad the face
The heart of the intelligent seeketh knowledge
All the days of the afflicted `are' evil
Better `is' a little with the fear of Jehovah
Better `is' an allowance of green herbs and love there
A man of fury stirreth up contention
The way of the slothful `is' as a hedge of briers
A wise son rejoiceth a father. And a foolish man is despising his mother."
Folly is joy to one lacking heart
Without counsel `is' the making void of purposes
Joy `is' to a man in the answer of his mouth
A path of life `is' on high for the wise
The house of the proud Jehovah pulleth down
An abomination to Jehovah `are' thoughts of wickedness
A dishonest gainer is troubling his house
The heart of the righteous meditateth to answer
Far `is' Jehovah from the wicked
The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart
An ear that is hearing the reproof of life Doth lodge among the wise."
Whoso is refusing instruction is despising his soul
The fear of Jehovah `is' the instruction of wisdom
