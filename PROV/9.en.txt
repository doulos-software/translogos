Wisdom hath builded her house
She hath slaughtered her slaughter
She hath sent forth her damsels
`Who `is' simple? let him turn aside hither.' Whoso lacketh heart: she hath said to him
`Come
Forsake ye
The instructor of a scorner Is receiving for it -- shame
Reprove not a scorner
Give to the wise
The commencement of wisdom `is' the fear of Jehovah
For by me do thy days multiply
If thou hast been wise
A foolish woman `is' noisy
And she hath sat at the opening of her house
To call to those passing by the way
`Who `is' simple? let him turn aside hither.' And whoso lacketh heart -- she said to him
`Stolen waters are sweet
And he hath not known that Rephaim `are' there
