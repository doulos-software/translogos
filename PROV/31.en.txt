Words of Lemuel a king
`What
Give not to women thy strength
Not for kings
Lest he drink
Give strong drink to the perishing
He drinketh
Open thy mouth for the dumb
Open thy mouth
A woman of worth who doth find? Yea
The heart of her husband hath trusted in her
She hath done him good
She hath sought wool and flax
She hath been as ships of the merchant
Yea
She hath considered a field
She hath girded with might her loins
She hath perceived when her merchandise `is' good
Her hands she hath sent forth on a spindle
Her hand she hath spread forth to the poor
She is not afraid of her household from snow
Ornamental coverings she hath made for herself
Known in the gates is her husband
Linen garments she hath made
Strength and honour `are' her clothing
Her mouth she hath opened in wisdom
She `is' watching the ways of her household
Her sons have risen up
`Many `are' the daughters who have done worthily
The grace `is' false
Give ye to her of the fruit of her hands
