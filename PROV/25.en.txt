Also these are Proverbs of Solomon
The honour of God `is' to hide a thing
The heavens for height
Take away dross from silver
Take away the wicked before a king
Honour not thyself before a king
For better `that' he hath said to thee
Go not forth to strive
Thy cause plead with thy neighbour
Lest the hearer put thee to shame
Apples of gold in imagery of silver
A ring of gold
As a vessel of snow in a day of harvest
Clouds and wind
By long-suffering is a ruler persuaded
Honey thou hast found -- eat thy sufficiency
Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house
A maul
A bad tooth
Whoso is taking away a garment in a cold day
If he who is hating thee doth hunger
For coals thou art putting on his head
A north wind bringeth forth rain
Better to sit on a corner of a roof
`As' cold waters for a weary soul
A spring troubled
The eating of much honey is not good
A city broken down without walls
