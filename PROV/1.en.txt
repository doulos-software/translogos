Proverbs of Solomon
For knowing wisdom and instruction
For receiving the instruction of wisdom
For giving to simple ones -- prudence
(The wise doth hear and increaseth learning
For understanding a proverb and its sweetness
Fear of Jehovah `is' a beginning of knowledge
Hear
For a graceful wreath `are' they to thy head
My son
If they say
We swallow them as Sheol -- alive
Every precious substance we find
Thy lot thou dost cast among us
My son! go not in the way with them
For their feet to evil do run
Surely in vain is the net spread out before the eyes of any bird."
And they for their own blood lay wait
So `are' the paths of every gainer of dishonest gain
Wisdom in an out-place crieth aloud
At the head of the multitudes she calleth
`Till when
Turn back at my reproof
Because I have called
And ye slight all my counsel
I also in your calamity do laugh
When your fear cometh as destruction
Then they call me
Because that they have hated knowledge
They have not consented to my counsel
And they eat of the fruit of their way
For the turning of the simple slayeth them
And whoso is hearkening to me dwelleth confidently
