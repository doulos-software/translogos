Be not envious of evil men
For destruction doth their heart meditate
By wisdom is a house builded
And by knowledge the inner parts are filled
Mighty `is' the wise in strength
For by plans thou makest for thyself war
Wisdom `is' high for a fool
Whoso is devising to do evil
The thought of folly `is' sin
Thou hast shewed thyself weak in a day of adversity
If `from' delivering those taken to death
When thou sayest
Eat my son
So `is' the knowledge of wisdom to thy soul
Lay not wait
For seven `times' doth the righteous fall and rise
In the falling of thine enemy rejoice not
Lest Jehovah see
Fret not thyself at evil doers
For there is not a posterity to the evil
Fear Jehovah
For suddenly doth their calamity rise
These also are for the wise: -- To discern faces in judgment is not good."
Whoso is saying to the wicked
And to those reproving it is pleasant
Lips he kisseth who is returning straightforward words."
Prepare in an out-place thy work
Be not a witness for nought against thy neighbour
Say not
Near the field of a slothful man I passed by
And lo
And I see -- I -- I do set my heart
A little sleep -- a little slumber -- A little folding of the hands to lie down."
And thy poverty hath come `as' a traveller
