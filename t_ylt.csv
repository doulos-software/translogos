"56001003","56","1","3","(and He manifested in proper times His word,) in preaching, which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our Saviour,"

"56001005","56","1","5","For this cause left I thee in Crete, that the things lacking thou mayest arrange, and mayest set down in every city elders, as I did appoint to thee;"
"56001006","56","1","6","if any one is blameless, of one wife a husband, having children stedfast, not under accusation of riotous living or insubordinate --"
"56001007","56","1","7","for it behoveth the overseer to be blameless, as God's steward, not self-pleased, nor irascible, not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre;"
"56001008","56","1","8","but a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, sober-minded, righteous, kind, self-controlled,"
"56001009","56","1","9","holding -- according to the teaching -- to the stedfast word, that he may be able also to exhort in the sound teaching, and the gainsayers to convict;"
"56001010","56","1","10","for there are many both insubordinate, vain-talkers, and mind-deceivers -- especially they of the circumcision --"
"56001011","56","1","11","whose mouth it behoveth to stop, who whole households do overturn, teaching what things it behoveth not, for filthy lucre's sake."
"56001012","56","1","12","A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said -- `Cretans! always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!'"
"56001013","56","1","13","this testimony is true; for which cause convict them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,"
"56001014","56","1","14","not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men, turning themselves away from the truth;"
"56001015","56","1","15","all things, indeed, `are' pure to the pure, and to the defiled and unstedfast `is' nothing pure, but of them defiled `are' even the mind and the conscience;"
"56001016","56","1","16","God they profess to know, and in the works they deny `Him', being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work disapproved."
"56002001","56","2","1","And thou -- be speaking what doth become the sound teaching;"
"56002002","56","2","2","aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith, in the love, in the endurance;"
"56002003","56","2","3","aged women, in like manner, in deportment as doth become sacred persons, not false accusers, to much wine not enslaved, of good things teachers,"
"56002004","56","2","4","that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of `their' husbands, lovers of `their' children,"
"56002005","56","2","5","sober, pure, keepers of `their own' houses, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of."
"56002006","56","2","6","The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be sober-minded;"

"56002011","56","2","11","For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men,"
"56002012","56","2","12","teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age,"
"56002013","56","2","13","waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,"
"56002014","56","2","14","who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;"
"56002015","56","2","15","these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise thee!"

"56003002","56","3","2","of no one to speak evil, not to be quarrelsome -- gentle, showing all meekness to all men,"
"56003003","56","3","3","for we were once -- also we -- thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving desires and pleasures manifold, in malice and envy living, odious -- hating one another;"
"56003004","56","3","4","and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour did appear"
"56003005","56","3","5","(not by works that `are' in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness,) He did save us, through a bathing of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Spirit,"
"56003006","56","3","6","which He poured upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,"
"56003007","56","3","7","that having been declared righteous by His grace, heirs we may become according to the hope of life age-during."
"56003008","56","3","8","Stedfast `is' the word; and concerning these things I counsel thee to affirm fully, that they may be thoughtful, to be leading in good works -- who have believed God; these are the good and profitable things to men,"
"56003009","56","3","9","and foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law, stand away from -- for they are unprofitable and vain."
"56003010","56","3","10","A sectarian man, after a first and second admonition be rejecting,"

"56003015","56","3","15","Salute thee do all those with me; salute those loving us in faith; the grace `is' with you all!"
"57001001","57","1","1","Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,"
"57001002","57","1","2","and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the assembly in thy house:"
"57001003","57","1","3","Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
"57001004","57","1","4","I give thanks to my God, always making mention of thee in my prayers,"
"57001005","57","1","5","hearing of thy love and faith that thou hast unto the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,"
"57001006","57","1","6","that the fellowship of thy faith may become working in the full knowledge of every good thing that `is' in you toward Christ Jesus;"
"57001007","57","1","7","for we have much joy and comfort in thy love, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother."
"57001008","57","1","8","Wherefore, having in Christ much boldness to command thee that which is fit --"
"57001009","57","1","9","because of the love I rather entreat, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;"
"57001010","57","1","10","I entreat thee concerning my child -- whom I did beget in my bonds -- Onesimus,"
"57001011","57","1","11","who once was to thee unprofitable, and now is profitable to me and to thee,"
"57001012","57","1","12","whom I did send again, and thou him (that is, my own bowels) receive,"
"57001013","57","1","13","whom I did wish to retain to myself, that in thy behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the good news,"
"57001014","57","1","14","and apart from thy mind I willed to do nothing, that as of necessity thy good deed may not be, but of willingness,"
"57001015","57","1","15","for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour, that age-duringly thou mayest have him,"
"57001016","57","1","16","no more as a servant, but above a servant -- a brother beloved, especially to me, and how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord!"
"57001017","57","1","17","If, then, with me thou hast fellowship, receive him as me,"
"57001018","57","1","18","and if he did hurt to thee, or doth owe anything, this to me be reckoning;"
"57001019","57","1","19","I, Paul did write with my hand, I -- I will repay; that I may not say that also thyself, besides, to me thou dost owe."
"57001020","57","1","20","Yes, brother, may I have profit of thee in the Lord; refresh my bowels in the Lord;"
"57001021","57","1","21","having been confident in thy obedience I did write to thee, having known that also above what I may say thou wilt do;"
"57001022","57","1","22","and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you."
"57001023","57","1","23","Salute thee doth Epaphras, (my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus,)"
"57001024","57","1","24","Markus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lukas, my fellow-workmen!"
"57001025","57","1","25","The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ `is' with your spirit! Amen."
"58001001","58","1","1","In many parts, and many ways, God of old having spoken to the fathers in the prophets,"
"58001002","58","1","2","in these last days did speak to us in a Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He did make the ages;"
"58001003","58","1","3","who being the brightness of the glory, and the impress of His subsistence, bearing up also the all things by the saying of his might -- through himself having made a cleansing of our sins, sat down at the right hand of the greatness in the highest,"
"58001004","58","1","4","having become so much better than the messengers, as he did inherit a more excellent name than they."
"58001005","58","1","5","For to which of the messengers said He ever, `My Son thou art -- I to-day have begotten thee?' and again, `I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son?'"
"58001006","58","1","6","and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world, He saith, `And let them bow before him -- all messengers of God;'"
"58001007","58","1","7","and unto the messengers, indeed, He saith, `Who is making His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;'"
"58001008","58","1","8","and unto the Son: `Thy throne, O God, `is' to the age of the age; a scepter of righteousness `is' the scepter of thy reign;"
"58001009","58","1","9","thou didst love righteousness, and didst hate lawlessness; because of this did He anoint thee -- God, thy God -- with oil of gladness above thy partners;'"
"58001010","58","1","10","and, `Thou, at the beginning, Lord, the earth didst found, and a work of thy hands are the heavens;"
"58001011","58","1","11","these shall perish, and Thou dost remain, and all, as a garment, shall become old,"
"58001012","58","1","12","and as a mantle Thou shall roll them together, and they shall be changed, and Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.'"
"58001013","58","1","13","And unto which of the messengers said He ever, `Sit at My right hand, till I may make thine enemies thy footstool?'"
"58001014","58","1","14","are they not all spirits of service -- for ministration being sent forth because of those about to inherit salvation?"
"58002001","58","2","1","Because of this it behoveth `us' more abundantly to take heed to the things heard, lest we may glide aside,"
"58002002","58","2","2","for if the word being spoken through messengers did become stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience did receive a just recompense,"
"58002003","58","2","3","how shall we escape, having neglected so great salvation? which a beginning receiving -- to be spoken through the Lord -- by those having heard was confirmed to us,"
"58002004","58","2","4","God also bearing joint-witness both with signs and wonders, and manifold powers, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to His will."
"58002005","58","2","5","For not to messengers did He subject the coming world, concerning which we speak,"
"58002006","58","2","6","and one in a certain place did testify fully, saying, `What is man, that Thou art mindful of him, or a son of man, that Thou dost look after him?"
"58002007","58","2","7","Thou didst make him some little less than messengers, with glory and honour Thou didst crown him, and didst set him over the works of Thy hands,"
"58002008","58","2","8","all things Thou didst put in subjection under his feet,' for in the subjecting to him the all things, nothing did He leave to him unsubjected, and now not yet do we see the all things subjected to him,"
"58002009","58","2","9","and him who was made some little less than messengers we see -- Jesus -- because of the suffering of the death, with glory and honour having been crowned, that by the grace of God for every one he might taste of death."
"58002010","58","2","10","For it was becoming to Him, because of whom `are' the all things, and through whom `are' the all things, many sons to glory bringing, the author of their salvation through sufferings to make perfect,"
"58002011","58","2","11","for both he who is sanctifying and those sanctified `are' all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,"
"58002012","58","2","12","saying, `I will declare Thy name to my brethren, in the midst of an assembly I will sing praise to Thee;' and again, `I will be trusting on Him;'"
"58002013","58","2","13","and again, `Behold I and the children that God did give to me.'"
"58002014","58","2","14","Seeing, then, the children have partaken of flesh and blood, he himself also in like manner did take part of the same, that through death he might destroy him having the power of death -- that is, the devil --"
"58002015","58","2","15","and might deliver those, whoever, with fear of death, throughout all their life, were subjects of bondage,"
"58002016","58","2","16","for, doubtless, of messengers it doth not lay hold, but of seed of Abraham it layeth hold,"
"58002017","58","2","17","wherefore it did behove him in all things to be made like to the brethren, that he might become a kind and stedfast chief-priest in the things with God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people,"
"58002018","58","2","18","for in that he suffered, himself being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted."
"58003001","58","3","1","Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the apostle and chief priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,"
"58003002","58","3","2","being stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in all his house,"
"58003003","58","3","3","for of more glory than Moses hath this one been counted worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house hath he who doth build it,"
"58003004","58","3","4","for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all things did build `is' God,"
"58003005","58","3","5","and Moses indeed `was' stedfast in all his house, as an attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be spoken,"
"58003006","58","3","6","and Christ, as a Son over his house, whose house are we, if the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope unto the end we hold fast."
"58003007","58","3","7","Wherefore, (as the Holy Spirit saith, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear --"
"58003008","58","3","8","ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness,"
"58003009","58","3","9","in which tempt Me did your fathers, they did prove Me, and saw My works forty years;"
"58003010","58","3","10","wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, Always do they go astray in heart, and these have not known My ways;"
"58003011","58","3","11","so I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest -- !')"
"58003012","58","3","12","See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God,"
"58003013","58","3","13","but exhort ye one another every day, while the To-day is called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of the sin,"
"58003014","58","3","14","for partakers we have become of the Christ, if the beginning of the confidence unto the end we may hold fast,"
"58003015","58","3","15","in its being said, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation,'"
"58003016","58","3","16","for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did come out of Egypt through Moses;"
"58003017","58","3","17","but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?"
"58003018","58","3","18","and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His rest, except to those who did not believe? --"
"58003019","58","3","19","and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief."
"58004001","58","4","1","We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short,"
"58004002","58","4","2","for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they, but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard,"
"58004003","58","4","3","for we do enter into the rest -- we who did believe, as He said, `So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest -- ;' and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world,"
"58004004","58","4","4","for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh `day' thus: `And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;'"
"58004005","58","4","5","and in this `place' again, `If they shall enter into My rest -- ;'"
"58004006","58","4","6","since then, it remaineth for certain to enter into it, and those who did first hear good news entered not in because of unbelief --"
"58004007","58","4","7","again He doth limit a certain day, `To-day,' (in David saying, after so long a time,) as it hath been said, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts,'"
"58004008","58","4","8","for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning another day have spoken after these things;"
"58004009","58","4","9","there doth remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of God,"
"58004010","58","4","10","for he who did enter into his rest, he also rested from his works, as God from His own."
"58004011","58","4","11","May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no one in the same example of the unbelief may fall,"
"58004012","58","4","12","for the reckoning of God is living, and working, and sharp above every two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing asunder both of soul and spirit, of joints also and marrow, and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart;"
"58004013","58","4","13","and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him, but all things `are' naked and open to His eyes -- with whom is our reckoning."
"58004014","58","4","14","Having, then, a great chief priest passed through the heavens -- Jesus the Son of God -- may we hold fast the profession,"
"58004015","58","4","15","for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathise with our infirmities, but `one' tempted in all things in like manner -- apart from sin;"
"58004016","58","4","16","we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace -- for seasonable help."
"58005001","58","5","1","For every chief priest -- out of men taken -- in behalf of men is set in things `pertaining' to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,"
"58005002","58","5","2","able to be gentle to those ignorant and going astray, since himself also is compassed with infirmity;"
"58005003","58","5","3","and because of this infirmity he ought, as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins;"
"58005004","58","5","4","and no one to himself doth take the honour, but he who is called by God, as also Aaron:"
"58005005","58","5","5","so also the Christ did not glorify himself to become chief priest, but He who spake unto him: `My Son thou art, I to-day have begotten thee;'"
"58005006","58","5","6","as also in another `place' He saith, `Thou `art' a priest -- to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;'"
"58005007","58","5","7","who in the days of his flesh both prayers and supplications unto Him who was able to save him from death -- with strong crying and tears -- having offered up, and having been heard in respect to that which he feared,"
"58005008","58","5","8","through being a Son, did learn by the things which he suffered -- the obedience,"
"58005009","58","5","9","and having been made perfect, he did become to all those obeying him a cause of salvation age-during,"
"58005010","58","5","10","having been addressed by God a chief priest, according to the order of Melchisedek,"
"58005011","58","5","11","concerning whom we have much discourse and of hard explanation to say, since ye have become dull of hearing,"
"58005012","58","5","12","for even owing to be teachers, because of the time, again ye have need that one teach you what `are' the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and ye have become having need of milk, and not of strong food,"
"58005013","58","5","13","for every one who is partaking of milk `is' unskilled in the word of righteousness -- for he is an infant,"
"58005014","58","5","14","and of perfect men is the strong food, who because of the use are having the senses exercised, unto the discernment both of good and of evil."
"58006001","58","6","1","Wherefore, having left the word of the beginning of the Christ, unto the perfection we may advance, not again a foundation laying of reformation from dead works, and of faith on God,"
"58006002","58","6","2","of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on also of hands, of rising again also of the dead, and of judgment age-during,"
"58006003","58","6","3","and this we will do, if God may permit,"
"58006004","58","6","4","for `it is' impossible for those once enlightened, having tasted also of the heavenly gift, and partakers having became of the Holy Spirit,"
"58006005","58","6","5","and did taste the good saying of God, the powers also of the coming age,"
"58006006","58","6","6","and having fallen away, again to renew `them' to reformation, having crucified again to themselves the Son of God, and exposed to public shame."
"58006007","58","6","7","For earth, that is drinking in the rain many times coming upon it, and is bringing forth herbs fit for those because of whom also it is dressed, doth partake of blessing from God,"
"58006008","58","6","8","and that which is bearing thorns and briers `is' disapproved of, and nigh to cursing, whose end `is' for burning;"
"58006009","58","6","9","and we are persuaded, concerning you, beloved, the things that are better, and accompanying salvation, though even thus we speak,"
"58006010","58","6","10","for God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the labour of the love, that ye shewed to His name, having ministered to the saints and ministering;"
"58006011","58","6","11","and we desire each one of you the same diligence to shew, unto the full assurance of the hope unto the end,"
"58006012","58","6","12","that ye may not become slothful, but followers of those who through faith and patient endurance are inheriting the promises."
"58006013","58","6","13","For to Abraham God, having made promise, seeing He was able to swear by no greater, did swear by Himself,"
"58006014","58","6","14","saying, `Blessing indeed I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee;'"
"58006015","58","6","15","and so, having patiently endured, he did obtain the promise;"
"58006016","58","6","16","for men indeed do swear by the greater, and an end of all controversy to them for confirmation `is' the oath,"
"58006017","58","6","17","in which God, more abundantly willing to shew to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, did interpose by an oath,"
"58006018","58","6","18","that through two immutable things, in which `it is' impossible for God to lie, a strong comfort we may have who did flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before `us',"
"58006019","58","6","19","which we have, as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and entering into that within the vail,"
"58006020","58","6","20","whither a forerunner for us did enter -- Jesus, after the order of Melchisedek chief priest having become -- to the age."
"58007001","58","7","1","For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of the kings, and did bless him,"
"58007002","58","7","2","to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first, indeed, being interpreted, `King of righteousness,' and then also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)"
"58007003","58","7","3","without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like to the Son of God, doth remain a priest continually."
"58007004","58","7","4","And see how great this one `is', to whom also a tenth Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils,"
"58007005","58","7","5","and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though they came forth out of the loins of Abraham;"
"58007006","58","7","6","and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he hath blessed,"
"58007007","58","7","7","and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is blessed --"
"58007008","58","7","8","and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there `he', who is testified to that he was living,"
"58007009","58","7","9","and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving tithes, hath paid tithes,"
"58007010","58","7","10","for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him."
"58007011","58","7","11","If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood -- for the people under it had received law -- what further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?"
"58007012","58","7","12","for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the law a change doth come,"
"58007013","58","7","13","for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,"
"58007014","58","7","14","for `it is' evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord, in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood."
"58007015","58","7","15","And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest,"
"58007016","58","7","16","who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life,"
"58007017","58","7","17","for He doth testify -- `Thou `art' a priest -- to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;'"
"58007018","58","7","18","for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness,"
"58007019","58","7","19","(for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw nigh to God."
"58007020","58","7","20","And inasmuch as `it is' not apart from oath, (for those indeed apart from oath are become priests,"
"58007021","58","7","21","and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him, `The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou `art' a priest -- to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;')"
"58007022","58","7","22","by so much of a better covenant hath Jesus become surety,"
"58007023","58","7","23","and those indeed are many who have become priests, because by death they are hindered from remaining;"
"58007024","58","7","24","and he, because of his remaining -- to the age, hath the priesthood not transient,"
"58007025","58","7","25","whence also he is able to save to the very end, those coming through him unto God -- ever living to make intercession for them."
"58007026","58","7","26","For such a chief priest did become us -- kind, harmless, undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens,"
"58007027","58","7","27","who hath no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;"
"58007028","58","7","28","for the law doth appoint men chief priests, having infirmity, but the word of the oath that `is' after the law `appointeth' the Son -- to the age having been perfected."
"58008001","58","8","1","And the sum concerning the things spoken of `is': we have such a chief priest, who did sit down at the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens,"
"58008002","58","8","2","of the holy places a servant, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord did set up, and not man,"
"58008003","58","8","3","for every chief priest to offer both gifts and sacrifices is appointed, whence `it is' necessary for this one to have also something that he may offer;"
"58008004","58","8","4","for if, indeed, he were upon earth, he would not be a priest -- (there being the priests who are offering according to the law, the gifts,"
"58008005","58","8","5","who unto an example and shadow do serve of the heavenly things, as Moses hath been divinely warned, being about to construct the tabernacle, for `See (saith He) thou mayest make all things according to the pattern that was shewn to thee in the mount;') --"
"58008006","58","8","6","and now he hath obtained a more excellent service, how much also of a better covenant is he mediator, which on better promises hath been sanctioned,"
"58008007","58","8","7","for if that first were faultless, a place would not have been sought for a second."
"58008008","58","8","8","For finding fault, He saith to them, `Lo, days come, saith the Lord, and I will complete with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, a new covenant,"
"58008009","58","8","9","not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day of My taking `them' by their hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt -- because they did not remain in My covenant, and I did not regard them, saith the Lord, --"
"58008010","58","8","10","because this `is' the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws into their mind, and upon their hearts I will write them, and I will be to them for a God, and they shall be to Me for a people;"
"58008011","58","8","11","and they shall not teach each his neighbour, and each his brother, saying, Know thou the Lord, because they shall all know Me from the small one of them unto the great one of them,"
"58008012","58","8","12","because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will remember no more;' --"
"58008013","58","8","13","in the saying `new,' He hath made the first old, and what doth become obsolete and is old `is' nigh disappearing."
"58009001","58","9","1","It had, indeed, then (even the first tabernacle) ordinances of service, also a worldly sanctuary,"
"58009002","58","9","2","for a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which was both the lamp-stand, and the table, and the bread of the presence -- which is called `Holy;'"
"58009003","58","9","3","and after the second vail a tabernacle that is called `Holy of holies,'"
"58009004","58","9","4","having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid all round about with gold, in which `is' the golden pot having the manna, and the rod of Aaron that budded, and the tables of the covenant,"
"58009005","58","9","5","and over it cherubim of the glory, overshadowing the mercy-seat, concerning which we are not now to speak particularly."
"58009006","58","9","6","And these things having been thus prepared, into the first tabernacle, indeed, at all times the priests do go in, performing the services,"
"58009007","58","9","7","and into the second, once in the year, only the chief priest, not apart from blood, which he doth offer for himself and the errors of the people,"
"58009008","58","9","8","the Holy Spirit this evidencing that not yet hath been manifested the way of the holy `places', the first tabernacle having yet a standing;"
"58009009","58","9","9","which `is' a simile in regard to the present time, in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are not able, in regard to conscience, to make perfect him who is serving,"
"58009010","58","9","10","only in victuals, and drinks, and different baptisms, and fleshly ordinances -- till the time of reformation imposed upon `them'."
"58009011","58","9","11","And Christ being come, chief priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands -- that is, not of this creation --"
"58009012","58","9","12","neither through blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, did enter in once into the holy places, age-during redemption having obtained;"
"58009013","58","9","13","for if the blood of bulls, and goats, and ashes of an heifer, sprinkling those defiled, doth sanctify to the purifying of the flesh,"
"58009014","58","9","14","how much more shall the blood of the Christ (who through the age-during Spirit did offer himself unblemished to God) purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
"58009015","58","9","15","And because of this, of a new covenant he is mediator, that, death having come, for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those called may receive the promise of the age-during inheritance,"
"58009016","58","9","16","for where a covenant `is', the death of the covenant-victim to come in is necessary,"
"58009017","58","9","17","for a covenant over dead victims `is' stedfast, since it is no force at all when the covenant-victim liveth,"
"58009018","58","9","18","whence not even the first apart from blood hath been initiated,"
"58009019","58","9","19","for every command having been spoken, according to law, by Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of the calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he both the book itself and all the people did sprinkle,"
"58009020","58","9","20","saying, `This `is' the blood of the covenant that God enjoined unto you,'"
"58009021","58","9","21","and both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service with blood in like manner he did sprinkle,"
"58009022","58","9","22","and with blood almost all things are purified according to the law, and apart from blood-shedding forgiveness doth not come."
"58009023","58","9","23","`It is' necessary, therefore, the pattern indeed of the things in the heavens to be purified with these, and the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these;"
"58009024","58","9","24","for not into holy places made with hands did the Christ enter -- figures of the true -- but into the heaven itself, now to be manifested in the presence of God for us;"
"58009025","58","9","25","nor that he may many times offer himself, even as the chief priest doth enter into the holy places every year with blood of others;"
"58009026","58","9","26","since it had behoved him many times to suffer from the foundation of the world, but now once, at the full end of the ages, for putting away of sin through his sacrifice, he hath been manifested;"
"58009027","58","9","27","and as it is laid up to men once to die, and after this -- judgment,"
"58009028","58","9","28","so also the Christ, once having been offered to bear the sins of many, a second time, apart from a sin-offering, shall appear, to those waiting for him -- to salvation!"
"58010001","58","10","1","For the law having a shadow of the coming good things -- not the very image of the matters, every year, by the same sacrifices that they offer continually, is never able to make perfect those coming near,"
"58010002","58","10","2","since, would they not have ceased to be offered, because of those serving having no more conscience of sins, having once been purified?"
"58010003","58","10","3","but in those `sacrifices' is a remembrance of sins every year,"
"58010004","58","10","4","for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take away sins."
"58010005","58","10","5","Wherefore, coming into the world, he saith, `Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not will, and a body Thou didst prepare for me,"
"58010006","58","10","6","in burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offerings, Thou didst not delight,"
"58010007","58","10","7","then I said, Lo, I come, (in a volume of the book it hath been written concerning me,) to do, O God, Thy will;'"
"58010008","58","10","8","saying above -- `Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offering Thou didst not will, nor delight in,' -- which according to the law are offered --"
"58010009","58","10","9","then he said, `Lo, I come to do, O God, Thy will;' he doth take away the first that the second he may establish;"
"58010010","58","10","10","in the which will we are having been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once,"
"58010011","58","10","11","and every priest, indeed, hath stood daily serving, and the same sacrifices many times offering, that are never able to take away sins."
"58010012","58","10","12","And He, for sin one sacrifice having offered -- to the end, did sit down on the right hand of God, --"
"58010013","58","10","13","as to the rest, expecting till He may place his enemies `as' his footstool,"
"58010014","58","10","14","for by one offering he hath perfected to the end those sanctified;"
"58010015","58","10","15","and testify to us also doth the Holy Spirit, for after that He hath said before,"
"58010016","58","10","16","`This `is' the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws on their hearts, and upon their minds I will write them,'"
"58010017","58","10","17","and `their sins and their lawlessness I will remember no more;'"
"58010018","58","10","18","and where forgiveness of these `is', there is no more offering for sin."
"58010019","58","10","19","Having, therefore, brethren, boldness for the entrance into the holy places, in the blood of Jesus,"
"58010020","58","10","20","which way he did initiate for us -- new and living, through the vail, that is, his flesh --"
"58010021","58","10","21","and a high priest over the house of God,"
"58010022","58","10","22","may we draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having the hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having the body bathed with pure water;"
"58010023","58","10","23","may we hold fast the unwavering profession of the hope, (for faithful `is' He who did promise),"
"58010024","58","10","24","and may we consider one another to provoke to love and to good works,"
"58010025","58","10","25","not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as a custom of certain `is', but exhorting, and so much the more as ye see the day coming nigh."
"58010026","58","10","26","For we -- willfully sinning after the receiving the full knowledge of the truth -- no more for sins doth there remain a sacrifice,"
"58010027","58","10","27","but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery zeal, about to devour the opposers;"
"58010028","58","10","28","any one who did set at nought a law of Moses, apart from mercies, by two or three witnesses, doth die,"
"58010029","58","10","29","of how much sorer punishment shall he be counted worthy who the Son of God did trample on, and the blood of the covenant did count a common thing, in which he was sanctified, and to the Spirit of the grace did despite?"
"58010030","58","10","30","for we have known Him who is saying, `Vengeance `is' Mine, I will recompense, saith the Lord;' and again, `The Lord shall judge His people;' --"
"58010031","58","10","31","fearful `is' the falling into the hands of a living God."
"58010032","58","10","32","And call to your remembrance the former days, in which, having been enlightened, ye did endure much conflict of sufferings,"
"58010033","58","10","33","partly both with reproaches and tribulations being made spectacles, and partly having become partners of those so living,"
"58010034","58","10","34","for also with my bonds ye sympathised, and the robbery of your goods with joy ye did receive, knowing that ye have in yourselves a better substance in the heavens, and an enduring one."
"58010035","58","10","35","Ye may not cast away, then, your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward,"
"58010036","58","10","36","for of patience ye have need, that the will of God having done, ye may receive the promise,"
"58010037","58","10","37","for yet a very very little, He who is coming will come, and will not tarry;"
"58010038","58","10","38","and `the righteous by faith shall live,' and `if he may draw back, My soul hath no pleasure in him,'"
"58010039","58","10","39","and we are not of those drawing back to destruction, but of those believing to a preserving of soul."
"58011001","58","11","1","And faith is of things hoped for a confidence, of matters not seen a conviction,"
"58011002","58","11","2","for in this were the elders testified of;"
"58011003","58","11","3","by faith we understand the ages to have been prepared by a saying of God, in regard to the things seen not having come out of things appearing;"
"58011004","58","11","4","by faith a better sacrifice did Abel offer to God than Cain, through which he was testified to be righteous, God testifying of his gifts, and through it, he being dead, doth yet speak."
"58011005","58","11","5","By faith Enoch was translated -- not to see death, and was not found, because God did translate him; for before his translation he had been testified to -- that he had pleased God well,"
"58011006","58","11","6","and apart from faith it is impossible to please well, for it behoveth him who is coming to God to believe that He is, and to those seeking Him He becometh a rewarder."
"58011007","58","11","7","By faith Noah, having been divinely warned concerning the things not yet seen, having feared, did prepare an ark to the salvation of his house, through which he did condemn the world, and of the righteousness according to faith he became heir."
"58011008","58","11","8","By faith Abraham, being called, did obey, to go forth to the place that he was about to receive for an inheritance, and he went forth, not knowing whither he doth go;"
"58011009","58","11","9","by faith he did sojourn in the land of the promise as a strange country, in tabernacles having dwelt with Isaac and Jacob, fellow-heirs of the same promise,"
"58011010","58","11","10","for he was looking for the city having the foundations, whose artificer and constructor `is' God."
"58011011","58","11","11","By faith also Sarah herself did receive power to conceive seed, and she bare after the time of life, seeing she did judge Him faithful who did promise;"
"58011012","58","11","12","wherefore, also from one were begotten -- and that of one who had become dead -- as the stars of the heaven in multitude, and as sand that `is' by the sea-shore -- the innumerable."
"58011013","58","11","13","In faith died all these, not having received the promises, but from afar having seen them, and having been persuaded, and having saluted `them', and having confessed that strangers and sojourners they are upon the earth,"
"58011014","58","11","14","for those saying such things make manifest that they seek a country;"
"58011015","58","11","15","and if, indeed, they had been mindful of that from which they came forth, they might have had an opportunity to return,"
"58011016","58","11","16","but now they long for a better, that is, an heavenly, wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for He did prepare for them a city."
"58011017","58","11","17","By faith Abraham hath offered up Isaac, being tried, and the only begotten he did offer up who did receive the promises,"
"58011018","58","11","18","of whom it was said -- `In Isaac shall a seed be called to thee;'"
"58011019","58","11","19","reckoning that even out of the dead God is able to raise up, whence also in a figure he did receive `him'."
"58011020","58","11","20","By faith, concerning coming things, Isaac did bless Jacob and Esau;"
"58011021","58","11","21","by faith Jacob dying -- each of the sons of Joseph did bless, and did bow down upon the top of his staff;"
"58011022","58","11","22","by faith, Joseph dying, concerning the outgoing of the sons of Israel did make mention, and concerning his bones did give command."
"58011023","58","11","23","By faith Moses, having been born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw the child comely, and were not afraid of the decree of the king;"
"58011024","58","11","24","by faith Moses, having become great, did refuse to be called a son of the daughter of Pharaoh,"
"58011025","58","11","25","having chosen rather to be afflicted with the people of God, than to have sin's pleasure for a season,"
"58011026","58","11","26","greater wealth having reckoned the reproach of the Christ than the treasures in Egypt, for he did look to the recompense of reward;"
"58011027","58","11","27","by faith he left Egypt behind, not having been afraid of the wrath of the king, for, as seeing the Invisible One -- he endured;"
"58011028","58","11","28","by faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that He who is destroying the first-born might not touch them."
"58011029","58","11","29","By faith they did pass through the Red Sea as through dry land, which the Egyptians having received a trial of, were swallowed up;"
"58011030","58","11","30","by faith the walls of Jericho did fall, having been surrounded for seven days;"
"58011031","58","11","31","by faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who disbelieved, having received the spies with peace."
"58011032","58","11","32","And what shall I yet say? for the time will fail me recounting about Gideon, Barak also, and Samson, and Jephthah, David also, and Samuel, and the prophets,"
"58011033","58","11","33","who through faith did subdue kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped mouths of lions,"
"58011034","58","11","34","quenched the power of fire, escaped the mouth of the sword, were made powerful out of infirmities, became strong in battle, caused to give way camps of the aliens."
"58011035","58","11","35","Women received by a rising again their dead, and others were tortured, not accepting the redemption, that a better rising again they might receive,"
"58011036","58","11","36","and others of mockings and scourgings did receive trial, and yet of bonds and imprisonment;"
"58011037","58","11","37","they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tried; in the killing of the sword they died; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins -- being destitute, afflicted, injuriously treated,"
"58011038","58","11","38","of whom the world was not worthy; in deserts wandering, and `in' mountains, and `in' caves, and `in' the holes of the earth;"
"58011039","58","11","39","and these all, having been testified to through the faith, did not receive the promise,"
"58011040","58","11","40","God for us something better having provided, that apart from us they might not be made perfect."
"58012001","58","12","1","Therefore, we also having so great a cloud of witnesses set around us, every weight having put off, and the closely besetting sin, through endurance may we run the contest that is set before us,"
"58012002","58","12","2","looking to the author and perfecter of faith -- Jesus, who, over-against the joy set before him -- did endure a cross, shame having despised, on the right hand also of the throne of God did sit down;"
"58012003","58","12","3","for consider again him who endured such gainsaying from the sinners to himself, that ye may not be wearied in your souls -- being faint."
"58012004","58","12","4","Not yet unto blood did ye resist -- with the sin striving;"
"58012005","58","12","5","and ye have forgotten the exhortation that doth speak fully with you as with sons, `My son, be not despising chastening of the Lord, nor be faint, being reproved by Him,"
"58012006","58","12","6","for whom the Lord doth love He doth chasten, and He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth;'"
"58012007","58","12","7","if chastening ye endure, as to sons God beareth Himself to you, for who is a son whom a father doth not chasten?"
"58012008","58","12","8","and if ye are apart from chastening, of which all have become partakers, then bastards are ye, and not sons."
"58012009","58","12","9","Then, indeed, fathers of our flesh we have had, chastising `us', and we were reverencing `them'; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of the spirits, and live?"
"58012010","58","12","10","for they, indeed, for a few days, according to what seemed good to them, were chastening, but He for profit, to be partakers of His separation;"
"58012011","58","12","11","and all chastening for the present, indeed, doth not seem to be of joy, but of sorrow, yet afterward the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those exercised through it -- it doth yield."
"58012012","58","12","12","Wherefore, the hanging-down hands and the loosened knees set ye up;"
"58012013","58","12","13","and straight paths make for your feet, that that which is lame may not be turned aside, but rather be healed;"
"58012014","58","12","14","peace pursue with all, and the separation, apart from which no one shall see the Lord,"
"58012015","58","12","15","looking diligently over lest any one be failing of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up may give trouble, and through this many may be defiled;"
"58012016","58","12","16","lest any one be a fornicator, or a profane person, as Esau, who in exchange for one morsel of food did sell his birthright,"
"58012017","58","12","17","for ye know that also afterwards, wishing to inherit the blessing, he was disapproved of, for a place of reformation he found not, though with tears having sought it."
"58012018","58","12","18","For ye came not near to the mount touched and scorched with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,"
"58012019","58","12","19","and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of sayings, which those having heard did entreat that a word might not be added to them,"
"58012020","58","12","20","for they were not bearing that which is commanded, `And if a beast may touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or with an arrow shot through,'"
"58012021","58","12","21","and, (so terrible was the sight,) Moses said, `I am fearful exceedingly, and trembling.'"
"58012022","58","12","22","But, ye came to Mount Zion, and to a city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of messengers,"
"58012023","58","12","23","to the company and assembly of the first-born in heaven enrolled, and to God the judge of all, and to spirits of righteous men made perfect,"
"58012024","58","12","24","and to a mediator of a new covenant -- Jesus, and to blood of sprinkling, speaking better things than that of Abel!"
"58012025","58","12","25","See, may ye not refuse him who is speaking, for if those did not escape who refused him who upon earth was divinely speaking -- much less we who do turn away from him who `speaketh' from heaven,"
"58012026","58","12","26","whose voice the earth shook then, and now hath he promised, saying, `Yet once -- I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven;'"
"58012027","58","12","27","and this -- `Yet once' -- doth make evident the removal of the things shaken, as of things having been made, that the things not shaken may remain;"
"58012028","58","12","28","wherefore, a kingdom that cannot be shaken receiving, may we have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly, with reverence and religious fear;"
"58012029","58","12","29","for also our God `is' a consuming fire."
"58013001","58","13","1","Let brotherly love remain;"
"58013002","58","13","2","of the hospitality be not forgetful, for through this unawares certain did entertain messengers;"
"58013003","58","13","3","be mindful of those in bonds, as having been bound with them, of those maltreated, as also yourselves being in the body;"
"58013004","58","13","4","honourable `is' the marriage in all, and the bed undefiled, and whoremongers and adulterers God shall judge."
"58013005","58","13","5","Without covetousness the behaviour, being content with the things present, for He hath said, `No, I will not leave, no, nor forsake thee,'"
"58013006","58","13","6","so that we do boldly say, `The Lord `is' to me a helper, and I will not fear what man shall do to me.'"
"58013007","58","13","7","Be mindful of those leading you, who did speak to you the word of God, whose faith -- considering the issue of the behaviour -- be imitating,"
"58013008","58","13","8","Jesus Christ yesterday and to-day the same, and to the ages;"
"58013009","58","13","9","with teachings manifold and strange be not carried about, for `it is' good that by grace the heart be confirmed, not with meats, in which they who were occupied were not profited;"
"58013010","58","13","10","we have an altar, of which to eat they have no authority who the tabernacle are serving,"
"58013011","58","13","11","for of those beasts whose blood is brought for sin into the holy places through the chief priest -- of these the bodies are burned without the camp."
"58013012","58","13","12","Wherefore, also Jesus -- that he might sanctify through `his' own blood the people -- without the gate did suffer;"
"58013013","58","13","13","now, then, may we go forth unto him without the camp, his reproach bearing;"
"58013014","58","13","14","for we have not here an abiding city, but the coming one we seek;"
"58013015","58","13","15","through him, then, we may offer up a sacrifice of praise always to God, that is, the fruit of lips, giving thanks to His name;"
"58013016","58","13","16","and of doing good, and of fellowship, be not forgetful, for with such sacrifices God is well-pleased."
"58013017","58","13","17","Be obedient to those leading you, and be subject, for these do watch for your souls, as about to give account, that with joy they may do this, and not sighing, for this `is' unprofitable to you."
"58013018","58","13","18","Pray for us, for we trust that we have a good conscience, in all things willing to behave well,"
"58013019","58","13","19","and more abundantly do I call upon `you' to do this, that more quickly I may be restored to you."
"58013020","58","13","20","And the God of the peace, who did bring up out of the dead the great shepherd of the sheep -- in the blood of an age-during covenant -- our Lord Jesus,"
"58013021","58","13","21","make you perfect in every good work to do His will, doing in you that which is well-pleasing before Him, through Jesus Christ, to whom `is' the glory -- to the ages of the ages! Amen."
"58013022","58","13","22","And I entreat you, brethren, suffer the word of the exhortation, for also through few words I have written to you."
"58013023","58","13","23","Know ye that the brother Timotheus is released, with whom, if he may come more shortly, I will see you."
"58013024","58","13","24","Salute all those leading you, and all the saints; salute you doth those from Italy:"
"58013025","58","13","25","the grace `is' with you all! Amen."
"59001001","59","1","1","James, of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ a servant, to the Twelve Tribes who are in the dispersion: Hail!"
"59001002","59","1","2","All joy count `it', my brethren, when ye may fall into temptations manifold;"
"59001003","59","1","3","knowing that the proof of your faith doth work endurance,"
"59001004","59","1","4","and let the endurance have a perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire -- in nothing lacking;"
"59001005","59","1","5","and if any of you do lack wisdom, let him ask from God, who is giving to all liberally, and not reproaching, and it shall be given to him;"
"59001006","59","1","6","and let him ask in faith, nothing doubting, for he who is doubting hath been like a wave of the sea, driven by wind and tossed,"
"59001007","59","1","7","for let not that man suppose that he shall receive anything from the Lord --"
"59001008","59","1","8","a two-souled man `is' unstable in all his ways."
"59001009","59","1","9","And let the brother who is low rejoice in his exaltation,"
"59001010","59","1","10","and the rich in his becoming low, because as a flower of grass he shall pass away;"
"59001011","59","1","11","for the sun did rise with the burning heat, and did wither the grass, and the flower of it fell, and the grace of its appearance did perish, so also the rich in his way shall fade away!"
"59001012","59","1","12","Happy the man who doth endure temptation, because, becoming approved, he shall receive the crown of the life, which the Lord did promise to those loving Him."
"59001013","59","1","13","Let no one say, being tempted -- `From God I am tempted,' for God is not tempted of evil, and Himself doth tempt no one,"
"59001014","59","1","14","and each one is tempted, by his own desires being led away and enticed,"
"59001015","59","1","15","afterward the desire having conceived, doth give birth to sin, and the sin having been perfected, doth bring forth death."
"59001016","59","1","16","Be not led astray, my brethren beloved;"
"59001017","59","1","17","every good giving, and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the lights, with whom is no variation, or shadow of turning;"
"59001018","59","1","18","having counselled, He did beget us with a word of truth, for our being a certain first-fruit of His creatures."
"59001019","59","1","19","So then, my brethren beloved, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger,"
"59001020","59","1","20","for the wrath of a man the righteousness of God doth not work;"
"59001021","59","1","21","wherefore having put aside all filthiness and superabundance of evil, in meekness be receiving the engrafted word, that is able to save your souls;"
"59001022","59","1","22","and become ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves,"
"59001023","59","1","23","because, if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, this one hath been like to a man viewing his natural face in a mirror,"
"59001024","59","1","24","for he did view himself, and hath gone away, and immediately he did forget of what kind he was;"
"59001025","59","1","25","and he who did look into the perfect law -- that of liberty, and did continue there, this one -- not a forgetful hearer becoming, but a doer of work -- this one shall be happy in his doing."
"59001026","59","1","26","If any one doth think to be religious among you, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his heart, of this one vain `is' the religion;"
"59001027","59","1","27","religion pure and undefiled with the God and Father is this, to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation -- unspotted to keep himself from the world."
"59002001","59","2","1","My brethren, hold not, in respect of persons, the faith of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
"59002002","59","2","2","for if there may come into your synagogue a man with gold ring, in gay raiment, and there may come in also a poor man in vile raiment,"
"59002003","59","2","3","and ye may look upon him bearing the gay raiment, and may say to him, `Thou -- sit thou here well,' and to the poor man may say, `Thou -- stand thou there, or, Sit thou here under my footstool,' --"
"59002004","59","2","4","ye did not judge fully in yourselves, and did become ill-reasoning judges."
"59002005","59","2","5","Hearken, my brethren beloved, did not God choose the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the reign that He promised to those loving Him?"
"59002006","59","2","6","and ye did dishonour the poor one; do not the rich oppress you and themselves draw you to judgment-seats;"
"59002007","59","2","7","do they not themselves speak evil of the good name that was called upon you?"
"59002008","59","2","8","If, indeed, royal law ye complete, according to the Writing, `Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,' -- ye do well;"
"59002009","59","2","9","and if ye accept persons, sin ye do work, being convicted by the law as transgressors;"
"59002010","59","2","10","for whoever the whole law shall keep, and shall stumble in one `point', he hath become guilty of all;"
"59002011","59","2","11","for He who is saying, `Thou mayest not commit adultery,' said also, `Thou mayest do no murder;' and if thou shalt not commit adultery, and shalt commit murder, thou hast become a transgressor of law;"
"59002012","59","2","12","so speak ye and so do, as about by a law of liberty to be judged,"
"59002013","59","2","13","for the judgment without kindness `is' to him not having done kindness, and exult doth kindness over judgment."
"59002014","59","2","14","What `is' the profit, my brethren, if faith, any one may speak of having, and works he may not have? is that faith able to save him?"
"59002015","59","2","15","and if a brother or sister may be naked, and may be destitute of the daily food,"
"59002016","59","2","16","and any one of you may say to them, `Depart ye in peace, be warmed, and be filled,' and may not give to them the things needful for the body, what `is' the profit?"
"59002017","59","2","17","so also the faith, if it may not have works, is dead by itself."
"59002018","59","2","18","But say may some one, Thou hast faith, and I have works, shew me thy faith out of thy works, and I will shew thee out of my works my faith:"
"59002019","59","2","19","thou -- thou dost believe that God is one; thou dost well, and the demons believe, and they shudder!"
"59002020","59","2","20","And dost thou wish to know, O vain man, that the faith apart from the works is dead?"
"59002021","59","2","21","Abraham our father -- was not he declared righteous out of works, having brought up Isaac his son upon the altar?"
"59002022","59","2","22","dost thou see that the faith was working with his works, and out of the works the faith was perfected?"
"59002023","59","2","23","and fulfilled was the Writing that is saying, `And Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness;' and, `Friend of God' he was called."
"59002024","59","2","24","Ye see, then, that out of works is man declared righteous, and not out of faith only;"
"59002025","59","2","25","and in like manner also Rahab the harlot -- was she not out of works declared righteous, having received the messengers, and by another way having sent forth?"
"59002026","59","2","26","for as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also the faith apart from the works is dead."
"59003001","59","3","1","Many teachers become not, my brethren, having known that greater judgment we shall receive,"
"59003002","59","3","2","for we all make many stumbles; if any one in word doth not stumble, this one `is' a perfect man, able to bridle also the whole body;"
"59003003","59","3","3","lo, the bits we put into the mouths of the horses for their obeying us, and their whole body we turn about;"
"59003004","59","3","4","lo, also the ships, being so great, and by fierce winds being driven, are led about by a very small helm, whithersoever the impulse of the helmsman doth counsel,"
"59003005","59","3","5","so also the tongue is a little member, and doth boast greatly; lo, a little fire how much wood it doth kindle!"
"59003006","59","3","6","and the tongue `is' a fire, the world of the unrighteousness, so the tongue is set in our members, which is spotting our whole body, and is setting on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by the gehenna."
"59003007","59","3","7","For every nature, both of beasts and of fowls, both of creeping things and things of the sea, is subdued, and hath been subdued, by the human nature,"
"59003008","59","3","8","and the tongue no one of men is able to subdue, `it is' an unruly evil, full of deadly poison,"
"59003009","59","3","9","with it we do bless the God and Father, and with it we do curse the men made according to the similitude of God;"
"59003010","59","3","10","out of the same mouth doth come forth blessing and cursing; it doth not need, my brethren, these things so to happen;"
"59003011","59","3","11","doth the fountain out of the same opening pour forth the sweet and the bitter?"
"59003012","59","3","12","is a fig-tree able, my brethren, olives to make? or a vine figs? so no fountain salt and sweet water `is able' to make."
"59003013","59","3","13","Who `is' wise and intelligent among you? let him shew out of the good behaviour his works in meekness of wisdom,"
"59003014","59","3","14","and if bitter zeal ye have, and rivalry in your heart, glory not, nor lie against the truth;"
"59003015","59","3","15","this wisdom is not descending from above, but earthly, physical, demon-like,"
"59003016","59","3","16","for where zeal and rivalry `are', there is insurrection and every evil matter;"
"59003017","59","3","17","and the wisdom from above, first, indeed, is pure, then peaceable, gentle, easily entreated, full of kindness and good fruits, uncontentious, and unhypocritical: --"
"59003018","59","3","18","and the fruit of the righteousness in peace is sown to those making peace."
"59004001","59","4","1","Whence `are' wars and fightings among you? not thence -- out of your passions, that are as soldiers in your members?"
"59004002","59","4","2","ye desire, and ye have not; ye murder, and are zealous, and are not able to attain; ye fight and war, and ye have not, because of your not asking;"
"59004003","59","4","3","ye ask, and ye receive not, because evilly ye ask, that in your pleasures ye may spend `it'."
"59004004","59","4","4","Adulterers and adulteresses! have ye not known that friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever, then, may counsel to be a friend of the world, an enemy of God he is set."
"59004005","59","4","5","Do ye think that emptily the Writing saith, `To envy earnestly desireth the spirit that did dwell in us,'"
"59004006","59","4","6","and greater grace he doth give, wherefore he saith, `God against proud ones doth set Himself up, and to lowly ones He doth give grace?'"
"59004007","59","4","7","be subject, then, to God; stand up against the devil, and he will flee from you;"
"59004008","59","4","8","draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you; cleanse hands, ye sinners! and purify hearts, ye two-souled!"
"59004009","59","4","9","be exceeding afflicted, and mourn, and weep, let your laughter to mourning be turned, and the joy to heaviness;"
"59004010","59","4","10","be made low before the Lord, and He shall exalt you."
"59004011","59","4","11","Speak not one against another, brethren; he who is speaking against a brother, and is judging his brother, doth speak against law, and doth judge law, and if law thou dost judge, thou art not a doer of law but a judge;"
"59004012","59","4","12","one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy; thou -- who art thou that dost judge the other?"
"59004013","59","4","13","Go, now, ye who are saying, `To-day and to-morrow we will go on to such a city, and will pass there one year, and traffic, and make gain;'"
"59004014","59","4","14","who do not know the thing of the morrow; for what is your life? for it is a vapour that is appearing for a little, and then is vanishing;"
"59004015","59","4","15","instead of your saying, `If the Lord may will, we shall live, and do this or that;'"
"59004016","59","4","16","and now ye glory in your pride; all such glorying is evil;"
"59004017","59","4","17","to him, then, knowing to do good, and not doing, sin it is to him."
"59005001","59","5","1","Go, now, ye rich! weep, howling over your miseries that are coming upon `you';"
"59005002","59","5","2","your riches have rotted, and your garments have become moth-eaten;"
"59005003","59","5","3","your gold and silver have rotted, and the rust of them for a testimony shall be to you, and shall eat your flesh as fire. Ye made treasure in the last days!"
"59005004","59","5","4","lo, the reward of the workmen, of those who in-gathered your fields, which hath been fraudulently kept back by you -- doth cry out, and the exclamations of those who did reap into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth have entered;"
"59005005","59","5","5","ye did live in luxury upon the earth, and were wanton; ye did nourish your hearts, as in a day of slaughter;"
"59005006","59","5","6","ye did condemn -- ye did murder the righteous one, he doth not resist you."
"59005007","59","5","7","Be patient, then, brethren, till the presence of the Lord; lo, the husbandman doth expect the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it, till he may receive rain -- early and latter;"
"59005008","59","5","8","be patient, ye also; establish your hearts, because the presence of the Lord hath drawn nigh;"
"59005009","59","5","9","murmur not against one another, brethren, that ye may not be condemned; lo, the Judge before the door hath stood."
"59005010","59","5","10","An example take ye of the suffering of evil, my brethren, and of the patience, the prophets who did speak in the name of the Lord;"
"59005011","59","5","11","lo, we call happy those who are enduring; the endurance of Job ye heard of, and the end of the Lord ye have seen, that very compassionate is the Lord, and pitying."
"59005012","59","5","12","And before all things, my brethren, do not swear, neither by the heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath, and let your Yes be Yes, and the No, No; that under judgment ye may not fall."
"59005013","59","5","13","Doth any one suffer evil among you? let him pray; is any of good cheer? let him sing psalms;"
"59005014","59","5","14","is any infirm among you? let him call for the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil, in the name of the Lord,"
"59005015","59","5","15","and the prayer of the faith shall save the distressed one, and the Lord shall raise him up, and if sins he may have committed, they shall be forgiven to him."
"59005016","59","5","16","Be confessing to one another the trespasses, and be praying for one another, that ye may be healed; very strong is a working supplication of a righteous man;"
"59005017","59","5","17","Elijah was a man like affected as we, and with prayer he did pray -- not to rain, and it did not rain upon the land three years and six months;"
"59005018","59","5","18","and again he did pray, and the heaven did give rain, and the land did bring forth her fruit."
"59005019","59","5","19","Brethren, if any among you may go astray from the truth, and any one may turn him back,"
"59005020","59","5","20","let him know that he who did turn back a sinner from the straying of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins."
"60001001","60","1","1","Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the choice sojourners of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,"
"60001002","60","1","2","according to a foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied!"
"60001003","60","1","3","Blessed `is' the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to the abundance of His kindness did beget us again to a living hope, through the rising again of Jesus Christ out of the dead,"
"60001004","60","1","4","to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and unfading, reserved in the heavens for you,"
"60001005","60","1","5","who, in the power of God are being guarded, through faith, unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time,"
"60001006","60","1","6","in which ye are glad, a little now, if it be necessary, being made to sorrow in manifold trials,"
"60001007","60","1","7","that the proof of your faith -- much more precious than of gold that is perishing, and through fire being approved -- may be found to praise, and honour, and glory, in the revelation of Jesus Christ,"
"60001008","60","1","8","whom, not having seen, ye love, in whom, now not seeing and believing, ye are glad with joy unspeakable and glorified,"
"60001009","60","1","9","receiving the end of your faith -- salvation of souls;"
"60001010","60","1","10","concerning which salvation seek out and search out did prophets who concerning the grace toward you did prophecy,"
"60001011","60","1","11","searching in regard to what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ that was in them was manifesting, testifying beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory after these,"
"60001012","60","1","12","to whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they were ministering these, which now were told to you (through those who did proclaim good news to you,) in the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, to which things messengers do desire to bend looking."
"60001013","60","1","13","Wherefore having girded up the loins of your mind, being sober, hope perfectly upon the grace that is being brought to you in the revelation of Jesus Christ,"
"60001014","60","1","14","as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves to the former desires in your ignorance,"
"60001015","60","1","15","but according as He who did call you `is' holy, ye also, become holy in all behaviour,"
"60001016","60","1","16","because it hath been written, `Become ye holy, because I am holy;'"
"60001017","60","1","17","and if on the Father ye do call, who without acceptance of persons is judging according to the work of each, in fear the time of your sojourn pass ye,"
"60001018","60","1","18","having known that, not with corruptible things -- silver or gold -- were ye redeemed from your foolish behaviour delivered by fathers,"
"60001019","60","1","19","but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and unspotted -- Christ's --"
"60001020","60","1","20","foreknown, indeed, before the foundation of the world, and manifested in the last times because of you,"
"60001021","60","1","21","who through him do believe in God, who did raise out of the dead, and glory to him did give, so that your faith and hope may be in God."
"60001022","60","1","22","Your souls having purified in the obedience of the truth through the Spirit to brotherly love unfeigned, out of a pure heart one another love ye earnestly,"

"60001024","60","1","24","because all flesh `is' as grass, and all glory of man as flower of grass; wither did the grass, and the flower of it fell away,"
"60001025","60","1","25","and the saying of the Lord doth remain -- to the age; and this is the saying that was proclaimed good news to you."
"60002001","60","2","1","Having put aside, then, all evil, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envyings, and all evil speakings,"

"60002003","60","2","3","if so be ye did taste that the Lord `is' gracious,"
"60002004","60","2","4","to whom coming -- a living stone -- by men, indeed, having been disapproved of, but with God choice, precious,"
"60002005","60","2","5","and ye yourselves, as living stones, are built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
"60002006","60","2","6","Wherefore, also, it is contained in the Writing: `Lo, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone, choice, precious, and he who is believing on him may not be put to shame;'"
"60002007","60","2","7","to you, then, who are believing `is' the preciousness; and to the unbelieving, a stone that the builders disapproved of, this one did become for the head of a corner,"
"60002008","60","2","8","and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence -- who are stumbling at the word, being unbelieving, -- to which also they were set;"
"60002009","60","2","9","and ye `are' a choice race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired, that the excellences ye may shew forth of Him who out of darkness did call you to His wondrous light;"
"60002010","60","2","10","who `were' once not a people, and `are' now the people of God; who had not found kindness, and now have found kindness."
"60002011","60","2","11","Beloved, I call upon `you', as strangers and sojourners, to keep from the fleshly desires, that war against the soul,"
"60002012","60","2","12","having your behaviour among the nations right, that in that which they speak against you as evil-doers, of the good works having beheld, they may glorify God in a day of inspection."
"60002013","60","2","13","Be subject, then, to every human creation, because of the Lord, whether to a king, as the highest,"
"60002014","60","2","14","whether to governors, as to those sent through him, for punishment, indeed, of evil-doers, and a praise of those doing good;"
"60002015","60","2","15","because, so is the will of God, doing good, to put to silence the ignorance of the foolish men;"
"60002016","60","2","16","as free, and not having the freedom as the cloak of the evil, but as servants of God;"
"60002017","60","2","17","to all give ye honour; the brotherhood love ye; God fear ye; the king honour ye."
"60002018","60","2","18","The domestics! be subjecting yourselves in all fear to the masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the cross;"
"60002019","60","2","19","for this `is' gracious, if because of conscience toward God any one doth endure sorrows, suffering unrighteously;"
"60002020","60","2","20","for what renown `is it', if sinning and being buffeted, ye do endure `it'? but if, doing good and suffering `for it', ye do endure, this `is' gracious with God,"
"60002021","60","2","21","for to this ye were called, because Christ also did suffer for you, leaving to you an example, that ye may follow his steps,"
"60002022","60","2","22","who did not commit sin, nor was guile found in his mouth,"
"60002023","60","2","23","who being reviled -- was not reviling again, suffering -- was not threatening, and was committing himself to Him who is judging righteously,"
"60002024","60","2","24","who our sins himself did bear in his body, upon the tree, that to the sins having died, to the righteousness we may live; by whose stripes ye were healed,"
"60002025","60","2","25","for ye were as sheep going astray, but ye turned back now to the shepherd and overseer of your souls."
"60003001","60","3","1","In like manner, the wives, be ye subject to your own husbands, that even if certain are disobedient to the word, through the conversation of the wives, without the word, they may be won,"
"60003002","60","3","2","having beheld your pure behaviour in fear,"
"60003003","60","3","3","whose adorning -- let it not be that which is outward, of plaiting of hair, and of putting around of things of gold, or of putting on of garments,"
"60003004","60","3","4","but -- the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible thing of the meek and quiet spirit, which is, before God, of great price,"
"60003005","60","3","5","for thus once also the holy women who did hope on God, were adorning themselves, being subject to their own husbands,"
"60003006","60","3","6","as Sarah was obedient to Abraham, calling him `sir,' of whom ye did become daughters, doing good, and not fearing any terror."
"60003007","60","3","7","The husbands, in like manner, dwelling with `them', according to knowledge, as to a weaker vessel -- to the wife -- imparting honour, as also being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered."
"60003008","60","3","8","And finally, being all of one mind, having fellow-feeling, loving as brethren, compassionate, courteous,"
"60003009","60","3","9","not giving back evil for evil, or railing for railing, and on the contrary, blessing, having known that to this ye were called, that a blessing ye may inherit;"
"60003010","60","3","10","for `he who is willing to love life, and to see good days, let him guard his tongue from evil, and his lips -- not to speak guile;"
"60003011","60","3","11","let him turn aside from evil, and do good, let him seek peace and pursue it;"
"60003012","60","3","12","because the eyes of the Lord `are' upon the righteous, and His ears -- to their supplication, and the face of the Lord `is' upon those doing evil;'"
"60003013","60","3","13","and who `is' he who will be doing you evil, if of Him who is good ye may become imitators?"
"60003014","60","3","14","but if ye also should suffer because of righteousness, happy `are ye'! and of their fear be not afraid, nor be troubled,"
"60003015","60","3","15","and the Lord God sanctify in your hearts. And `be' ready always for defence to every one who is asking of you an account concerning the hope that `is' in you, with meekness and fear;"
"60003016","60","3","16","having a good conscience, that in that in which they speak against you as evil-doers, they may be ashamed who are traducing your good behaviour in Christ;"
"60003017","60","3","17","for `it is' better doing good, if the will of God will it, to suffer, than doing evil;"
"60003018","60","3","18","because also Christ once for sin did suffer -- righteous for unrighteous -- that he might lead us to God, having been put to death indeed, in the flesh, and having been made alive in the spirit,"
"60003019","60","3","19","in which also to the spirits in prison having gone he did preach,"
"60003020","60","3","20","who sometime disbelieved, when once the long-suffering of God did wait, in days of Noah -- an ark being preparing -- in which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water;"
"60003021","60","3","21","also to which an antitype doth now save us -- baptism, (not a putting away of the filth of flesh, but the question of a good conscience in regard to God,) through the rising again of Jesus Christ,"
"60003022","60","3","22","who is at the right hand of God, having gone on to heaven -- messengers, and authorities, and powers, having been subjected to him."
"60004001","60","4","1","Christ, then, having suffered for us in the flesh, ye also with the same mind arm yourselves, because he who did suffer in the flesh hath done with sin,"
"60004002","60","4","2","no more in the desires of men, but in the will of God, to live the rest of the time in the flesh;"
"60004003","60","4","3","for sufficient to us `is' the past time of life the will of the nations to have wrought, having walked in lasciviousnesses, desires, excesses of wines, revelings, drinking-bouts, and unlawful idolatries,"
"60004004","60","4","4","in which they think it strange -- your not running with them to the same excess of dissoluteness, speaking evil,"
"60004005","60","4","5","who shall give an account to Him who is ready to judge living and dead,"
"60004006","60","4","6","for for this also to dead men was good news proclaimed, that they may be judged, indeed, according to men in the flesh, and may live according to God in the spirit."
"60004007","60","4","7","And of all things the end hath come nigh; be sober-minded, then, and watch unto the prayers,"
"60004008","60","4","8","and, before all things, to one another having the earnest love, because the love shall cover a multitude of sins;"
"60004009","60","4","9","hospitable to one another, without murmuring;"
"60004010","60","4","10","each, according as he received a gift, to one another ministering it, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God;"
"60004011","60","4","11","if any one doth speak -- `as oracles of God;' if any one doth minister -- `as of the ability which God doth supply;' that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the power -- to the ages of the ages. Amen."
"60004012","60","4","12","Beloved, think it not strange at the fiery suffering among you that is coming to try you, as if a strange thing were happening to you,"
"60004013","60","4","13","but, according as ye have fellowship with the sufferings of the Christ, rejoice ye, that also in the revelation of his glory ye may rejoice -- exulting;"
"60004014","60","4","14","if ye be reproached in the name of Christ -- happy `are ye', because the Spirit of glory and of God upon you doth rest; in regard, indeed, to them, he is evil-spoken of, and in regard to you, he is glorified;"
"60004015","60","4","15","for let none of you suffer as a murderer, or thief, or evil-doer, or as an inspector into other men's matters;"
"60004016","60","4","16","and if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; and let him glorify God in this respect;"
"60004017","60","4","17","because it is the time of the beginning of the judgment from the house of God, and if first from us, what the end of those disobedient to the good news of God?"
"60004018","60","4","18","And if the righteous man is scarcely saved, the ungodly and sinner -- where shall he appear?"
"60004019","60","4","19","so that also those suffering according to the will of god, as to a stedfast Creator, let them commit their own souls in good doing."
"60005001","60","5","1","Elders who `are' among you, I exhort, who `am' a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of the Christ, and of the glory about to be revealed a partaker,"
"60005002","60","5","2","feed the flock of God that `is' among you, overseeing not constrainedly, but willingly, neither for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind,"
"60005003","60","5","3","neither as exercising lordship over the heritages, but patterns becoming of the flock,"
"60005004","60","5","4","and at the manifestation of the chief Shepherd, ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory."
"60005005","60","5","5","In like manner, ye younger, be subject to elders, and all to one another subjecting yourselves; with humble-mindedness clothe yourselves, because God the proud doth resist, but to the humble He doth give grace;"
"60005006","60","5","6","be humbled, then, under the powerful hand of God, that you He may exalt in good time,"
"60005007","60","5","7","all your care having cast upon Him, because He careth for you."
"60005008","60","5","8","Be sober, vigilant, because your opponent the devil, as a roaring lion, doth walk about, seeking whom he may swallow up,"
"60005009","60","5","9","whom resist, stedfast in the faith, having known the same sufferings to your brotherhood in the world to be accomplished."
"60005010","60","5","10","And the God of all grace, who did call you to His age-during glory in Christ Jesus, having suffered a little, Himself make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle `you';"
"60005011","60","5","11","to Him `is' the glory, and the power -- to the ages and the ages! Amen."
"60005012","60","5","12","Through Silvanus, to you the faithful brother, as I reckon, through few `words' I did write, exhorting and testifying this to be the true grace of God in which ye have stood."
"60005013","60","5","13","Salute you doth the `assembly' in Babylon jointly elected, and Markus my son."
"60005014","60","5","14","Salute ye one another in a kiss of love; peace to you all who `are' in Christ Jesus! Amen."
"61001001","61","1","1","Simeon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who did obtain a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:"
"61001002","61","1","2","Grace to you, and peace be multiplied in the acknowledgement of God and of Jesus our Lord!"
"61001003","61","1","3","As all things to us His divine power (the things pertaining unto life and piety) hath given, through the acknowledgement of him who did call us through glory and worthiness,"
"61001004","61","1","4","through which to us the most great and precious promises have been given, that through these ye may become partakers of a divine nature, having escaped from the corruption in the world in desires."
"61001005","61","1","5","And this same also -- all diligence having brought in besides, superadd in your faith the worthiness, and in the worthiness the knowledge,"
"61001006","61","1","6","and in the knowledge the temperance, and in the temperance the endurance, and in the endurance the piety,"
"61001007","61","1","7","and in the piety the brotherly kindness, and in the brotherly kindness the love;"
"61001008","61","1","8","for these things being to you and abounding, do make `you' neither inert nor unfruitful in regard to the acknowledging of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
"61001009","61","1","9","for he with whom these things are not present is blind, dim-sighted, having become forgetful of the cleansing of his old sins;"
"61001010","61","1","10","wherefore, the rather, brethren, be diligent to make stedfast your calling and choice, for these things doing, ye may never stumble,"
"61001011","61","1","11","for so, richly shall be superadded to you the entrance into the age-during reign of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."
"61001012","61","1","12","Wherefore, I will not be careless always to remind you concerning these things, though, having known them, and having been established in the present truth,"
"61001013","61","1","13","and I think right, so long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up in reminding `you',"
"61001014","61","1","14","having known that soon is the laying aside of my tabernacle, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ did shew to me,"
"61001015","61","1","15","and I will be diligent that also at every time ye have, after my outgoing, power to make to yourselves the remembrance of these things."
"61001016","61","1","16","For, skilfully devised fables not having followed out, we did make known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but eye-witnesses having become of his majesty --"
"61001017","61","1","17","for having received from God the Father honour and glory, such a voice being borne to him by the excellent glory: `This is My Son -- the beloved, in whom I was well pleased;'"
"61001018","61","1","18","and this voice we -- we did hear, out of heaven borne, being with him in the holy mount."
"61001019","61","1","19","And we have more firm the prophetic word, to which we do well giving heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, till day may dawn, and a morning star may arise -- in your hearts;"
"61001020","61","1","20","this first knowing, that no prophecy of the Writing doth come of private exposition,"
"61001021","61","1","21","for not by will of man did ever prophecy come, but by the Holy Spirit borne on holy men of God spake."
"61002001","61","2","1","And there did come also false prophets among the people, as also among you there shall be false teachers, who shall bring in besides destructive sects, and the Master who bought them denying, bringing to themselves quick destruction,"
"61002002","61","2","2","and many shall follow out their destructive ways, because of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of,"
"61002003","61","2","3","and in covetousness, with moulded words, of you they shall make merchandise, whose judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction doth not slumber."
"61002004","61","2","4","For if God messengers who sinned did not spare, but with chains of thick gloom, having cast `them' down to Tartarus, did deliver `them' to judgment, having been reserved,"
"61002005","61","2","5","and the old world did not spare, but the eighth person, Noah, of righteousness a preacher, did keep, a flood on the world of the impious having brought,"
"61002006","61","2","6","and the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah having turned to ashes, with an overthrow did condemn, an example to those about to be impious having set `them';"
"61002007","61","2","7","and righteous Lot, worn down by the conduct in lasciviousness of the impious, He did rescue,"
"61002008","61","2","8","for in seeing and hearing, the righteous man, dwelling among them, day by day the righteous soul with unlawful works was harassing."
"61002009","61","2","9","The Lord hath known to rescue pious ones out of temptation, and unrighteous ones to a day of judgment, being punished, to keep,"
"61002010","61","2","10","and chiefly those going behind the flesh in desire of uncleanness, and lordship despising; presumptuous, self-complacent, dignities they are not afraid to speak evil of,"
"61002011","61","2","11","whereas messengers, in strength and power being greater, do not bear against them before the Lord an evil speaking judgment;"
"61002012","61","2","12","and these, as irrational natural beasts, made to be caught and destroyed -- in what things they are ignorant of, speaking evil -- in their destruction shall be destroyed,"
"61002013","61","2","13","about to receive a reward of unrighteousness, pleasures counting the luxury in the day, spots and blemishes, luxuriating in their deceits, feasting with you,"
"61002014","61","2","14","having eyes full of adultery, and unable to cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having an heart exercised in covetousnesses, children of a curse,"
"61002015","61","2","15","having forsaken a right way, they did go astray, having followed in the way of Balaam the `son' of Bosor, who a reward of unrighteousness did love,"
"61002016","61","2","16","and had a rebuke of his own iniquity -- a dumb ass, in man's voice having spoken, did forbid the madness of the prophet."
"61002017","61","2","17","These are wells without water, and clouds by a tempest driven, to whom the thick gloom of the darkness to the age hath been kept;"
"61002018","61","2","18","for overswellings of vanity speaking, they do entice in desires of the flesh -- lasciviousnesses, those who had truly escaped from those conducting themselves in error,"
"61002019","61","2","19","liberty to them promising, themselves being servants of the corruption, for by whom any one hath been overcome, to this one also he hath been brought to servitude,"
"61002020","61","2","20","for, if having escaped from the pollutions of the world, in the acknowledging of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and by these again being entangled, they have been overcome, become to them hath the last things worse than the first,"
"61002021","61","2","21","for it were better to them not to have acknowledged the way of the righteousness, than having acknowledged `it', to turn back from the holy command delivered to them,"
"61002022","61","2","22","and happened to them hath that of the true similitude; `A dog did turn back upon his own vomit,' and, `A sow having bathed herself -- to rolling in mire.'"
"61003001","61","3","1","This, now, beloved, a second letter to you I write, in both which I stir up your pure mind in reminding `you',"
"61003002","61","3","2","to be mindful of the sayings said before by the holy prophets, and of the command of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour,"
"61003003","61","3","3","this first knowing, that there shall come in the latter end of the days scoffers, according to their own desires going on,"
"61003004","61","3","4","and saying, `Where is the promise of his presence? for since the fathers did fall asleep, all things so remain from the beginning of the creation;'"
"61003005","61","3","5","for this is unobserved by them willingly, that the heavens were of old, and the earth out of water and through water standing together by the word of God,"
"61003006","61","3","6","through which the then world, by water having been deluged, was destroyed;"
"61003007","61","3","7","and the present heavens and the earth, by the same word are treasured, for fire being kept to a day of judgment and destruction of the impious men."
"61003008","61","3","8","And this one thing let not be unobserved by you, beloved, that one day with the Lord `is' as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day;"
"61003009","61","3","9","the Lord is not slow in regard to the promise, as certain count slowness, but is long-suffering to us, not counselling any to be lost but all to pass on to reformation,"
"61003010","61","3","10","and it will come -- the day of the Lord -- as a thief in the night, in which the heavens with a rushing noise will pass away, and the elements with burning heat be dissolved, and earth and the works in it shall be burnt up."
"61003011","61","3","11","All these, then, being dissolved, what kind of persons doth it behove you to be in holy behaviours and pious acts?"
"61003012","61","3","12","waiting for and hasting to the presence of the day of God, by which the heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements with burning heat shall melt;"
"61003013","61","3","13","and for new heavens and a new earth according to His promise we do wait, in which righteousness doth dwell;"
"61003014","61","3","14","wherefore, beloved, these things waiting for, be diligent, spotless and unblameable, by Him to be found in peace,"
"61003015","61","3","15","and the long-suffering of our Lord count ye salvation, according as also our beloved brother Paul -- according to the wisdom given to him -- did write to you,"
"61003016","61","3","16","as also in all the epistles, speaking in them concerning these things, among which things are certain hard to be understood, which the untaught and unstable do wrest, as also the other Writings, unto their own destruction."
"61003017","61","3","17","Ye, then, beloved, knowing before, take heed, lest, together with the error of the impious being led away, ye may fall from your own stedfastness,"
"61003018","61","3","18","and increase ye in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; to him `is' the glory both now, and to the day of the age! Amen."
"62001001","62","1","1","That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we did behold, and our hands did handle, concerning the Word of the Life --"
"62001002","62","1","2","and the Life was manifested, and we have seen, and do testify, and declare to you the Life, the age-during, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us --"
"62001003","62","1","3","that which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that ye also may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship `is' with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ;"
"62001004","62","1","4","and these things we write to you, that your joy may be full."
"62001005","62","1","5","And this is the message that we have heard from Him, and announce to you, that God is light, and darkness in Him is not at all;"
"62001006","62","1","6","if we may say -- `we have fellowship with Him,' and in the darkness may walk -- we lie, and do not the truth;"
"62001007","62","1","7","and if in the light we may walk, as He is in the light -- we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son doth cleanse us from every sin;"
"62001008","62","1","8","if we may say -- `we have not sin,' ourselves we lead astray, and the truth is not in us;"
"62001009","62","1","9","if we may confess our sins, stedfast He is and righteous that He may forgive us the sins, and may cleanse us from every unrighteousness;"
"62001010","62","1","10","if we may say -- `we have not sinned,' a liar we make Him, and His word is not in us."
"62002001","62","2","1","My little children, these things I write to you, that ye may not sin: and if any one may sin, an advocate we have with the Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one,"
"62002002","62","2","2","and he -- he is a propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world,"
"62002003","62","2","3","and in this we know that we have known him, if his commands we may keep;"
"62002004","62","2","4","he who is saying, `I have known him,' and his command is not keeping, a liar he is, and in him the truth is not;"
"62002005","62","2","5","and whoever may keep his word, truly in him the love of God hath been perfected; in this we know that in him we are."
"62002006","62","2","6","He who is saying in him he doth remain, ought according as he walked also himself so to walk."
"62002007","62","2","7","Brethren, a new command I write not to you, but an old command, that ye had from the beginning -- the old command is the word that ye heard from the beginning;"
"62002008","62","2","8","again, a new command I write to you, which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness doth pass away, and the true light doth now shine;"
"62002009","62","2","9","he who is saying, in the light he is, and his brother is hating, in the darkness he is till now;"
"62002010","62","2","10","he who is loving his brother, in the light he doth remain, and a stumbling-block in him there is not;"
"62002011","62","2","11","and he who is hating his brother, in the darkness he is, and in the darkness he doth walk, and he hath not known whither he doth go, because the darkness did blind his eyes."
"62002012","62","2","12","I write to you, little children, because the sins have been forgiven you through his name;"
"62002013","62","2","13","I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him who `is' from the beginning; I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the evil. I write to you, little youths, because ye have known the Father:"
"62002014","62","2","14","I did write to you, fathers, because ye have known him who `is' from the beginning; I did write to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God in you doth remain, and ye have overcome the evil."
"62002015","62","2","15","Love not ye the world, nor the things in the world; if any one doth love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,"
"62002016","62","2","16","because all that `is' in the world -- the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the ostentation of the life -- is not of the Father, but of the world,"
"62002017","62","2","17","and the world doth pass away, and the desire of it, and he who is doing the will of God, he doth remain -- to the age."
"62002018","62","2","18","Little youths, it is the last hour; and even as ye heard that the antichrist doth come, even now antichrists have become many -- whence we know that it is the last hour;"
"62002019","62","2","19","out of us they went forth, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but -- that they might be manifested that they are not all of us."
"62002020","62","2","20","And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and have known all things;"
"62002021","62","2","21","I did not write to you because ye have not known the truth, but because ye have known it, and because no lie is of the truth."
"62002022","62","2","22","Who is the liar, except he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ? this one is the antichrist who is denying the Father and the Son;"
"62002023","62","2","23","every one who is denying the Son, neither hath he the Father, `he who is confessing the Son hath the Father also.'"
"62002024","62","2","24","Ye, then, that which ye heard from the beginning, in you let it remain; if in you may remain that which from the beginning ye did hear, ye also in the Son and in the Father shall remain,"
"62002025","62","2","25","and this is the promise that He did promise us -- the life the age-during."
"62002026","62","2","26","These things I did write to you concerning those leading you astray;"
"62002027","62","2","27","and you, the anointing that ye did receive from him, in you it doth remain, and ye have no need that any one may teach you, but as the same anointing doth teach you concerning all, and is true, and is not a lie, and even as was taught you, ye shall remain in him."
"62002028","62","2","28","And now, little children, remain in him, that when he may be manifested, we may have boldness, and may not be ashamed before him, in his presence;"
"62002029","62","2","29","if ye know that he is righteous, know ye that every one doing the righteousness, of him hath been begotten."
"62003001","62","3","1","See ye what love the Father hath given to us, that children of God we may be called; because of this the world doth not know us, because it did not know Him;"
"62003002","62","3","2","beloved, now, children of God are we, and it was not yet manifested what we shall be, and we have known that if he may be manifested, like him we shall be, because we shall see him as he is;"
"62003003","62","3","3","and every one who is having this hope on him, doth purify himself, even as he is pure."
"62003004","62","3","4","Every one who is doing the sin, the lawlessness also he doth do, and the sin is the lawlessness,"
"62003005","62","3","5","and ye have known that he was manifested that our sins he may take away, and sin is not in him;"
"62003006","62","3","6","every one who is remaining in him doth not sin; every one who is sinning, hath not seen him, nor known him."
"62003007","62","3","7","Little children, let no one lead you astray; he who is doing the righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous,"
"62003008","62","3","8","he who is doing the sin, of the devil he is, because from the beginning the devil doth sin; for this was the Son of God manifested, that he may break up the works of the devil;"
"62003009","62","3","9","every one who hath been begotten of God, sin he doth not, because his seed in him doth remain, and he is not able to sin, because of God he hath been begotten."
"62003010","62","3","10","In this manifest are the children of God, and the children of the devil; every one who is not doing righteousness, is not of God, and he who is not loving his brother,"
"62003011","62","3","11","because this is the message that ye did hear from the beginning, that we may love one another,"
"62003012","62","3","12","not as Cain -- of the evil one he was, and he did slay his brother, and wherefore did he slay him? because his works were evil, and those of his brother righteous."
"62003013","62","3","13","Do not wonder, my brethren, if the world doth hate you;"
"62003014","62","3","14","we -- we have known that we have passed out of the death to the life, because we love the brethren; he who is not loving the brother doth remain in the death."
"62003015","62","3","15","Every one who is hating his brother -- a man-killer he is, and ye have known that no man-killer hath life age-during in him remaining,"
"62003016","62","3","16","in this we have known the love, because he for us his life did lay down, and we ought for the brethren the lives to lay down;"
"62003017","62","3","17","and whoever may have the goods of the world, and may view his brother having need, and may shut up his bowels from him -- how doth the love of God remain in him?"
"62003018","62","3","18","My little children, may we not love in word nor in tongue, but in word and in truth!"
"62003019","62","3","19","and in this we know that of the truth we are, and before Him we shall assure our hearts,"
"62003020","62","3","20","because if our heart may condemn -- because greater is God than our heart, and He doth know all things."
"62003021","62","3","21","Beloved, if our heart may not condemn us, we have boldness toward God,"
"62003022","62","3","22","and whatever we may ask, we receive from Him, because His commands we keep, and the things pleasing before Him we do,"
"62003023","62","3","23","and this is His command, that we may believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and may love one another, even as He did give command to us,"
"62003024","62","3","24","and he who is keeping His commands, in Him he doth remain, and He in him; and in this we know that He doth remain in us, from the Spirit that He gave us."
"62004001","62","4","1","Beloved, every spirit believe not, but prove the spirits, if of God they are, because many false prophets have gone forth to the world;"
"62004002","62","4","2","in this know ye the Spirit of God; every spirit that doth confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come, of God it is,"
"62004003","62","4","3","and every spirit that doth not confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come, of God it is not; and this is that of the antichrist, which ye heard that it doth come, and now in the world it is already."
"62004004","62","4","4","Ye -- of God ye are, little children, and ye have overcome them; because greater is He who `is' in you, than he who is in the world."
"62004005","62","4","5","They -- of the world they are; because of this from the world they speak, and the world doth hear them;"
"62004006","62","4","6","we -- of God we are; he who is knowing God doth hear us; he who is not of God, doth not hear us; from this we know the spirit of the truth, and the spirit of the error."
"62004007","62","4","7","Beloved, may we love one another, because the love is of God, and every one who is loving, of God he hath been begotten, and doth know God;"
"62004008","62","4","8","he who is not loving did not know God, because God is love."
"62004009","62","4","9","In this was manifested the love of God in us, because His Son -- the only begotten -- hath God sent to the world, that we may live through him;"
"62004010","62","4","10","in this is the love, not that we loved God, but that He did love us, and did send His Son a propitiation for our sins."
"62004011","62","4","11","Beloved, if thus did God love us, we also ought one another to love;"
"62004012","62","4","12","God no one hath ever seen; if we may love one another, God in us doth remain, and His love is having been perfected in us;"
"62004013","62","4","13","in this we know that in Him we do remain, and He in us, because of His Spirit He hath given us."
"62004014","62","4","14","And we -- we have seen and do testify, that the Father hath sent the Son -- Saviour of the world;"
"62004015","62","4","15","whoever may confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God in him doth remain, and he in God;"
"62004016","62","4","16","and we -- we have known and believed the love, that God hath in us; God is love, and he who is remaining in the love, in God he doth remain, and God in him."
"62004017","62","4","17","In this made perfect hath been the love with us, that boldness we may have in the day of the judgment, because even as He is, we -- we also are in this world;"
"62004018","62","4","18","fear is not in the love, but the perfect love doth cast out the fear, because the fear hath punishment, and he who is fearing hath not been made perfect in the love;"
"62004019","62","4","19","we -- we love him, because He -- He first loved us;"
"62004020","62","4","20","if any one may say -- `I love God,' and his brother he may hate, a liar he is; for he who is not loving his brother whom he hath seen, God -- whom he hath not seen -- how is he able to love?"
"62004021","62","4","21","and this `is' the command we have from Him, that he who is loving God, may also love his brother."
"62005001","62","5","1","Every one who is believing that Jesus is the Christ, of God he hath been begotten, and every one who is loving Him who did beget, doth love also him who is begotten of Him:"
"62005002","62","5","2","in this we know that we love the children of God, when we may love God, and His commands may keep;"
"62005003","62","5","3","for this is the love of God, that His commands we may keep, and His commands are not burdensome;"
"62005004","62","5","4","because every one who is begotten of God doth overcome the world, and this is the victory that did overcome the world -- our faith;"
"62005005","62","5","5","who is he who is overcoming the world, if not he who is believing that Jesus is the Son of God?"
"62005006","62","5","6","This one is he who did come through water and blood -- Jesus the Christ, not in the water only, but in the water and the blood; and the Spirit it is that is testifying, because the Spirit is the truth,"
"62005007","62","5","7","because three are who are testifying `in the heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these -- the three -- are one;"
"62005008","62","5","8","and three are who are testifying in the earth', the Spirit, and the water, and the blood, and the three are into the one."
"62005009","62","5","9","If the testimony of men we receive, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that He hath testified concerning His Son."
"62005010","62","5","10","He who is believing in the Son of God, hath the testimony in himself; he who is not believing God, a liar hath made Him, because he hath not believed in the testimony that God hath testified concerning His Son;"
"62005011","62","5","11","and this is the testimony, that life age-during did God give to us, and this -- the life -- is in His Son;"
"62005012","62","5","12","he who is having the Son, hath the life; he who is not having the Son of God -- the life he hath not."
"62005013","62","5","13","These things I did write to you who are believing in the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that life ye have age-during, and that ye may believe in the name of the Son of God."
"62005014","62","5","14","And this is the boldness that we have toward Him, that if anything we may ask according to his will, He doth hear us,"
"62005015","62","5","15","and if we have known that He doth hear us, whatever we may ask, we have known that we have the requests that we have requested from Him."
"62005016","62","5","16","If any one may see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and He shall give to him life to those sinning not unto death; there is sin to death, not concerning it do I speak that he may beseech;"
"62005017","62","5","17","all unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not unto death."
"62005018","62","5","18","We have known that every one who hath been begotten of God doth not sin, but he who was begotten of God doth keep himself, and the evil one doth not touch him;"
"62005019","62","5","19","we have known that of God we are, and the whole world in the evil doth lie;"
"62005020","62","5","20","and we have known that the Son of God is come, and hath given us a mind, that we may know Him who is true, and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ; this one is the true God and the life age-during!"

"63001002","63","1","2","because of the truth that is remaining in us, and with us shall be to the age,"
"63001003","63","1","3","there shall be with you grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love."
"63001004","63","1","4","I rejoiced exceedingly that I have found of thy children walking in truth, even as a command we did receive from the Father;"
"63001005","63","1","5","and now I beseech thee, Kyria, not as writing to thee a new command, but which we had from the beginning, that we may love one another,"
"63001006","63","1","6","and this is the love, that we may walk according to His commands; this is the command, even as ye did hear from the beginning, that in it ye may walk,"
"63001007","63","1","7","because many leading astray did enter into the world, who are not confessing Jesus Christ coming in flesh; this one is he who is leading astray, and the antichrist."
"63001008","63","1","8","See to yourselves that ye may not lose the things that we wrought, but a full reward may receive;"
"63001009","63","1","9","every one who is transgressing, and is not remaining in the teaching of the Christ, hath not God; he who is remaining in the teaching of the Christ, this one hath both the Father and the Son;"
"63001010","63","1","10","if any one doth come unto you, and this teaching doth not bear, receive him not into the house, and say not to him, `Hail!'"
"63001011","63","1","11","for he who is saying to him, `Hail,' hath fellowship with his evil works."
"63001012","63","1","12","Many things having to write to you, I did not intend through paper and ink, but I hope to come unto you, and speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full;"

"64001003","64","1","3","for I rejoiced exceedingly, brethren coming and testifying of the truth in thee, even as thou in truth dost walk;"
"64001004","64","1","4","greater than these things I have no joy, that I may hear of my children in truth walking."
"64001005","64","1","5","Beloved, faithfully dost thou do whatever thou mayest work to the brethren and to the strangers,"
"64001006","64","1","6","who did testify of thy love before an assembly, whom thou wilt do well, having sent forward worthily of God,"

"64001009","64","1","9","I did write to the assembly, but he who is loving the first place among them -- Diotrephes -- doth not receive us;"
"64001010","64","1","10","because of this, if I may come, I will cause him to remember his works that he doth, with evil words prating against us; and not content with these, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and those intending he doth forbid, and out of the assembly he doth cast."
"64001011","64","1","11","Beloved, be not thou following that which is evil, but that which is good; he who is doing good, of God he is, and he who is doing evil hath not seen God;"

"66006004","66","6","4","and there went forth another horse -- red, and to him who is sitting upon it, there was given to him to take the peace from the land, and that one another they may slay, and there was given to him a great sword."
"66006005","66","6","5","And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, `Come and behold!' and I saw, and lo, a black horse, and he who is sitting upon it is having a balance in his hand,"
"66006006","66","6","6","and I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, `A measure of wheat for a denary, and three measures of barley for a denary,' and `The oil and the wine thou mayest not injure.'"
"66006007","66","6","7","And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, `Come and behold!'"
"66006008","66","6","8","and I saw, and lo, a pale horse, and he who is sitting upon him -- his name is Death, and Hades doth follow with him, and there was given to them authority to kill, (over the fourth part of the land,) with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and by the beasts of the land."
"66006009","66","6","9","And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those slain because of the word of God, and because of the testimony that they held,"
"66006010","66","6","10","and they were crying with a great voice, saying, `Till when, O Master, the Holy and the True, dost Thou not judge and take vengeance of our blood from those dwelling upon the land?'"
"66006011","66","6","11","and there was given to each one white robes, and it was said to them that they may rest themselves yet a little time, till may be fulfilled also their fellow-servants and their brethren, who are about to be killed -- even as they."
"66006012","66","6","12","And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and lo, a great earthquake came, and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood,"
"66006013","66","6","13","and the stars of the heaven fell to the earth -- as a fig-tree doth cast her winter figs, by a great wind being shaken --"
"66006014","66","6","14","and heaven departed as a scroll rolled up, and every mountain and island -- out of their places they were moved;"
"66006015","66","6","15","and the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich, and the chiefs of thousands, and the mighty, and every servant, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains,"
"66006016","66","6","16","and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, `Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of Him who is sitting upon the throne, and from the anger of the Lamb,'"
"66006017","66","6","17","because come did the great day of His anger, and who is able to stand?"
"66007001","66","7","1","And after these things I saw four messengers, standing upon the four corners of the land, holding the four winds of the land, that the wind may not blow upon the land, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree;"
"66007002","66","7","2","and I saw another messenger going up from the rising of the sun, having a seal of the living God, and he did cry with a great voice to the four messengers, to whom it was given to injure the land and the sea, saying,"
"66007003","66","7","3","`Do not injure the land, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we may seal the servants of our God upon their foreheads.'"
"66007004","66","7","4","And I heard the number of those sealed, (144 thousands were sealed out of all the tribes of the sons of Israel):"
"66007005","66","7","5","of the tribe of Judah 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Reuben 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Gad 12 thousand were sealed;"
"66007006","66","7","6","of the tribe of Asher 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Naphtali 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Manasseh 12 thousand were sealed;"
"66007007","66","7","7","of the tribe of Simeon 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Levi 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Issachar 12 thousand were sealed;"
"66007008","66","7","8","of the tribe of Zebulun 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Joseph 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Benjamin 12 thousand were sealed."
"66007009","66","7","9","After these things I saw, and lo, a great multitude, which to number no one was able, out of all nations, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, and palms in their hands,"
"66007010","66","7","10","and crying with a great voice, saying, `The salvation `is' to Him who is sitting upon the throne -- to our God, and to the Lamb!'"
"66007011","66","7","11","And all the messengers stood around the throne, and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell upon their face, and bowed before God,"
"66007012","66","7","12","saying, `Amen! the blessing, and the glory, and the wisdom, and the thanksgiving, and the honour, and the power, and the strength, `are' to our God -- to the ages of the ages! Amen!'"
"66007013","66","7","13","And answer did one of the elders, saying to me, `These, who have been arrayed with the white robes -- who are they, and whence came they?'"
"66007014","66","7","14","and I have said to him, `Sir, thou hast known;' and he said to me, `These are those who are coming out of the great tribulation, and they did wash their robes, and they made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb;"
"66007015","66","7","15","because of this are they before the throne of God, and they do service to Him day and night in His sanctuary, and He who is sitting upon the throne shall tabernacle over them;"
"66007016","66","7","16","they shall not hunger any more, nor may the sun fall upon them, nor any heat,"
"66007017","66","7","17","because the Lamb that `is' in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters, and wipe away shall God every tear from their eyes.'"
"66008001","66","8","1","And when he openeth the seventh seal, there came silence in the heaven about half-an-hour,"
"66008002","66","8","2","and I saw the seven messengers who before God have stood, and there were given to them seven trumpets,"
"66008003","66","8","3","and another messenger did come, and he stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and there was given to him much perfume, that he may give `it' to the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar that `is' before the throne,"
"66008004","66","8","4","and go up did the smoke of the perfumes to the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the messenger, before God;"
"66008005","66","8","5","and the messenger took the censer, and did fill it out of the fire of the altar, and did cast `it' to the earth, and there came voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake."
"66008006","66","8","6","And the seven messengers who are having the seven trumpets did prepare themselves that they may sound;"
"66008007","66","8","7","and the first messenger did sound, and there came hail and fire, mingled with blood, and it was cast to the land, and the third of the trees was burnt up, and all the green grass was burnt up."
"66008008","66","8","8","And the second messenger did sound, and as it were a great mountain with fire burning was cast into the sea, and the third of the sea became blood,"
"66008009","66","8","9","and die did the third of the creatures that `are' in the sea, those having life, and the third of the ships were destroyed."
"66008010","66","8","10","And the third messenger did sound, and there fell out of the heaven a great star, burning as a lamp, and it did fall upon the third of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters,"
"66008011","66","8","11","and the name of the star is called Wormwood, and the third of the waters doth become wormwood, and many of the men did die of the waters, because they were made bitter."
"66008012","66","8","12","And the fourth messenger did sound, and smitten was the third of the sun, and the third of the moon, and the third of the stars, that darkened may be the third of them, and that the day may not shine -- the third of it, and the night in like manner."
"66008013","66","8","13","And I saw, and I heard one messenger, flying in the mid-heaven, saying with a great voice, `Wo, wo, wo, to those dwelling upon the land from the rest of the voices of the trumpet of the three messengers who are about to sound.'"
"66009001","66","9","1","And the fifth messenger did sound, and I saw a star out of the heaven having fallen to the earth, and there was given to it the key of the pit of the abyss,"
"66009002","66","9","2","and he did open the pit of the abyss, and there came up a smoke out of the pit as smoke of a great furnace, and darkened was the sun and the air, from the smoke of the pit."
"66009003","66","9","3","And out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth, and there was given to them authority, as scorpions of the earth have authority,"
"66009004","66","9","4","and it was said to them that they may not injure the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but -- the men only who have not the seal of God upon their foreheads,"
"66009005","66","9","5","and it was given to them that they may not kill them, but that they may be tormented five months, and their torment `is' as the torment of a scorpion, when it may strike a man;"
"66009006","66","9","6","and in those days shall men seek the death, and they shall not find it, and they shall desire to die, and the death shall flee from them."
"66009007","66","9","7","And the likenesses of the locusts `are' like to horses made ready to battle, and upon their heads as crowns like gold, and their faces as faces of men,"
"66009008","66","9","8","and they had hair as hair of women, and their teeth were as `those' of lions,"
"66009009","66","9","9","and they had breastplates as breastplates of iron, and the noise of their wings `is' as the noise of chariots of many horses running to battle;"
"66009010","66","9","10","and they have tails like to scorpions, and stings were in their tails; and their authority `is' to injure men five months;"
"66009011","66","9","11","and they have over them a king -- the messenger of the abyss -- a name `is' to him in Hebrew, Abaddon, and in the Greek he hath a name, Apollyon."
"66009012","66","9","12","The first wo did go forth, lo, there come yet two woes after these things."
"66009013","66","9","13","And the sixth messenger did sound, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the altar of gold that is before God,"
"66009014","66","9","14","saying to the sixth messenger who had the trumpet, `Loose the four messengers who are bound at the great river Euphrates;'"
"66009015","66","9","15","and loosed were the four messengers, who have been made ready for the hour, and day, and month, and year, that they may kill the third of men;"
"66009016","66","9","16","and the number of the forces of the horsemen `is' two myriads of myriads, and I heard the number of them."
"66009017","66","9","17","And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those sitting upon them, having breastplates of fire, and jacinth, and brimstone; and the heads of the horses `are' as heads of lions, and out of their mouths proceedeth fire, and smoke, and brimstone;"
"66009018","66","9","18","by these three were the third of men killed, from the fire, and from the smoke, and from the brimstone, that is proceeding out of their mouth,"
"66009019","66","9","19","for their authorities are in their mouth, and in their tails, for their tails `are' like serpents, having heads, and with them they do injure;"
"66009020","66","9","20","and the rest of men, who were not killed in these plagues, neither did reform from the works of their hands, that they may not bow before the demons, and idols, those of gold, and those of silver, and those of brass, and those of stone, and those of wood, that are neither able to see, nor to hear, nor to walk,"
"66009021","66","9","21","yea they did not reform from their murders, nor from their sorceries, nor from their whoredoms, nor from their thefts."
"66010001","66","10","1","And I saw another strong messenger coming down out of the heaven, arrayed with a cloud, and a rainbow upon the head, and his face as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire,"
"66010002","66","10","2","and he had in his hand a little scroll opened, and he did place his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the land,"
"66010003","66","10","3","and he cried with a great voice, as a lion doth roar, and when he cried, speak out did the seven thunders their voices;"
"66010004","66","10","4","and when the seven thunders spake their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice out of the heaven saying to me, `Seal the things that the seven thunders spake,' and, `Thou mayest not write these things.'"
"66010005","66","10","5","And the messenger whom I saw standing upon the sea, and upon the land, did lift up his hand to the heaven,"
"66010006","66","10","6","and did swear in Him who doth live to the ages of the ages, who did create the heaven and the things in it, and the land and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it -- that time shall not be yet,"
"66010007","66","10","7","but in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger, when he may be about to sound, and the secret of God may be finished, as He did declare to His own servants, to the prophets."
"66010008","66","10","8","And the voice that I heard out of the heaven is again speaking with me, and saying, `Go, take the little scroll that is open in the hand of the messenger who hath been standing upon the sea, and upon the land:'"
"66010009","66","10","9","and I went away unto the messenger, saying to him, `Give me the little scroll;' and he saith to me, `Take, and eat it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet -- as honey.'"
"66010010","66","10","10","And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the messenger, and did eat it up, and it was in my mouth as honey -- sweet, and when I did eat it -- my belly was made bitter;"
"66010011","66","10","11","and he saith to me, `It behoveth thee again to prophesy about peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings -- many.'"
"66011001","66","11","1","And there was given to me a reed like to a rod, and the messenger stood, saying, `Rise, and measure the sanctuary of God, and the altar, and those worshipping in it;"
"66011002","66","11","2","and the court that is without the sanctuary leave out, and thou mayest not measure it, because it was given to the nations, and the holy city they shall tread down forty-two months;"
"66011003","66","11","3","and I will give to My two witnesses, and they shall prophesy days, a thousand, two hundred, sixty, arrayed with sackcloth;"
"66011004","66","11","4","these are the two olive `trees', and the two lamp-stands that before the God of the earth do stand;"
"66011005","66","11","5","and if any one may will to injure them, fire doth proceed out of their mouth, and doth devour their enemies, and if any one may will to injure them, thus it behoveth him to be killed."
"66011006","66","11","6","These have authority to shut the heaven, that it may not rain rain in the days of their prophecy, and authority they have over the waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the land with every plague, as often as they may will."
"66011007","66","11","7","`And when they may finish their testimony, the beast that is coming up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them,"
"66011008","66","11","8","and their dead bodies `are' upon the broad-place of the great city (that is called spiritually Sodom, and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified,)"
"66011009","66","11","9","and they shall behold -- they of the peoples, and tribes, and tongues, and nations -- their dead bodies three days and a half, and their dead bodies they shall not suffer to be put into tombs,"
"66011010","66","11","10","and those dwelling upon the land shall rejoice over them, and shall make merry, and gifts they shall send to one another, because these -- the two prophets -- did torment those dwelling upon the land.'"
"66011011","66","11","11","And after the three days and a half, a spirit of life from God did enter into them, and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon those beholding them,"
"66011012","66","11","12","and they heard a great voice out of the heaven saying to them, `Come up hither;' and they went up to the heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them;"
"66011013","66","11","13","and in that hour came a great earthquake, and the tenth of the city did fall, and killed in the earthquake were names of men -- seven thousands, and the rest became affrighted, and they gave glory to the God of the heaven."
"66011014","66","11","14","The second wo did go forth, lo, the third wo doth come quickly."
"66011015","66","11","15","And the seventh messenger did sound, and there came great voices in the heaven, saying, `The kingdoms of the world did become `those' of our Lord and of His Christ, and he shall reign to the ages of the ages!'"
"66011016","66","11","16","and the twenty and four elders, who before God are sitting upon their thrones, did fall upon their faces, and did bow before God,"
"66011017","66","11","17","saying, `We give thanks to Thee, O Lord God, the Almighty, who art, and who wast, and who art coming, because Thou hast taken Thy great power and didst reign;"
"66011018","66","11","18","and the nations were angry, and Thine anger did come, and the time of the dead, to be judged, and to give the reward to Thy servants, to the prophets, and to the saints, and to those fearing Thy name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those who are destroying the land.'"
"66011019","66","11","19","And opened was the sanctuary of God in the heaven, and there was seen the ark of His covenant in His sanctuary, and there did come lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail."
"66012001","66","12","1","And a great sign was seen in the heaven, a woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars,"
"66012002","66","12","2","and being with child she doth cry out, travailing and pained to bring forth."
"66012003","66","12","3","And there was seen another sign in the heaven, and, lo, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his head seven diadems,"
"66012004","66","12","4","and his tail doth draw the third of the stars of the heaven, and he did cast them to the earth; and the dragon did stand before the woman who is about to bring forth, that when she may bring forth, her child he may devour;"
"66012005","66","12","5","and she brought forth a male child, who is about to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, and caught away was her child unto God and His throne,"
"66012006","66","12","6","and the woman did flee to the wilderness, where she hath a place made ready from God, that there they may nourish her -- days a thousand, two hundred, sixty."
"66012007","66","12","7","And there came war in the heaven; Michael and his messengers did war against the dragon, and the dragon did war, and his messengers,"
"66012008","66","12","8","and they did not prevail, nor was their place found any more in the heaven;"
"66012009","66","12","9","and the great dragon was cast forth -- the old serpent, who is called `Devil,' and `the Adversary,' who is leading astray the whole world -- he was cast forth to the earth, and his messengers were cast forth with him."
"66012010","66","12","10","And I heard a great voice saying in the heaven, `Now did come the salvation, and the power, and the reign, of our God, and the authority of His Christ, because cast down was the accuser of our brethren, who is accusing them before our God day and night;"
"66012011","66","12","11","and they did overcome him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life -- unto death;"
"66012012","66","12","12","because of this be glad, ye heavens, and those in them who do tabernacle; wo to those inhabiting the land and the sea, because the Devil did go down unto you, having great wrath, having known that he hath little time.'"
"66012013","66","12","13","And when the dragon saw that he was cast forth to the earth, he pursued the woman who did bring forth the male,"
"66012014","66","12","14","and there were given to the woman two wings of the great eagle, that she may fly to the wilderness, to her place, where she is nourished a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent;"
"66012015","66","12","15","and the serpent did cast forth after the woman, out of his mouth, water as a river, that he may cause her to be carried away by the river,"
"66012016","66","12","16","and the land did help the woman, and the land did open its mouth and did swallow up the river, that the dragon did cast forth out of his mouth;"
"66012017","66","12","17","and the dragon was angry against the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, those keeping the commands of God, and having the testimony of Jesus Christ."
"66013001","66","13","1","And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and I saw out of the sea a beast coming up, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon its horns ten diadems, and upon its heads a name of evil speaking,"
"66013002","66","13","2","and the beast that I saw was like to a leopard, and its feet as of a bear, and its mouth as the mouth of a lion, and the dragon did give to it his power, and his throne, and great authority."
"66013003","66","13","3","And I saw one of its heads as slain to death, and its deadly stroke was healed, and all the earth did wonder after the beast,"
"66013004","66","13","4","and they did bow before the dragon who did give authority to the beast, and they did bow before the beast, saying, `Who `is' like to the beast? who is able to war with it?'"
"66013005","66","13","5","And there was given to it a mouth speaking great things, and evil-speakings, and there was given to it authority to make war forty-two months,"
"66013006","66","13","6","and it did open its mouth for evil-speaking toward God, to speak evil of His name, and of His tabernacle, and of those who in the heaven tabernacle,"
"66013007","66","13","7","and there was given to it to make war with the saints, and to overcome them, and there was given to it authority over every tribe, and tongue, and nation."
"66013008","66","13","8","And bow before it shall all who are dwelling upon the land, whose names have not been written in the scroll of the life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world;"
"66013009","66","13","9","if any one hath an ear -- let him hear:"
"66013010","66","13","10","if any one a captivity doth gather, into captivity he doth go away; if any one by sword doth kill, it behoveth him by sword to be killed; here is the endurance and the faith of the saints."
"66013011","66","13","11","And I saw another beast coming up out of the land, and it had two horns, like a lamb, and it was speaking as a dragon,"
"66013012","66","13","12","and all the authority of the first beast doth it do before it, and it maketh the land and those dwelling in it that they shall bow before the first beast, whose deadly stroke was healed,"
"66013013","66","13","13","and it doth great signs, that fire also it may make to come down from the heaven to the earth before men,"
"66013014","66","13","14","and it leadeth astray those dwelling on the land, because of the signs that were given it to do before the beast, saying to those dwelling upon the land to make an image to the beast that hath the stroke of the sword and did live,"
"66013015","66","13","15","and there was given to it to give a spirit to the image of the beast, that also the image of the beast may speak, and `that' it may cause as many as shall not bow before the image of the beast, that they may be killed."
"66013016","66","13","16","And it maketh all, the small, and the great, and the rich, and the poor, and the freemen, and the servants, that it may give to them a mark upon their right hand or upon their foreheads,"
"66013017","66","13","17","and that no one may be able to buy, or to sell, except he who is having the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."
"66013018","66","13","18","Here is the wisdom! He who is having the understanding, let him count the number of the beast, for the number of a man it is, and its number `is' 666."
"66014001","66","14","1","And I saw, and lo, a Lamb having stood upon the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty-four thousands, having the name of his Father written upon their foreheads;"
"66014002","66","14","2","and I heard a voice out of the heaven, as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of great thunder, and a voice I heard of harpers harping with their harps,"
"66014003","66","14","3","and they sing, as it were, a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders, and no one was able to learn the song except the hundred forty-four thousands, who have been bought from the earth;"
"66014004","66","14","4","these are they who with women were not defiled, for they are virgin; these are they who are following the Lamb whithersoever he may go; these were bought from among men -- a first-fruit to God and to the Lamb --"
"66014005","66","14","5","and in their mouth there was not found guile, for unblemished are they before the throne of God."
"66014006","66","14","6","And I saw another messenger flying in mid-heaven, having good news age-during to proclaim to those dwelling upon the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people,"
"66014007","66","14","7","saying in a great voice, `Fear ye God, and give to Him glory, because come did the hour of His judgment, and bow ye before Him who did make the heaven, and the land, and sea, and fountains of waters.'"
"66014008","66","14","8","And another messenger did follow, saying, `Fall, fall, did Babylon, the great city, because of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom she hath given to all nations to drink.'"
"66014009","66","14","9","And a third messenger did follow them, saying in a great voice, `If any one the beast doth bow before, and his image, and doth receive a mark upon his forehead, or upon his hand,"
"66014010","66","14","10","he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, that hath been mingled unmixed in the cup of His anger, and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy messengers, and before the Lamb,"
"66014011","66","14","11","and the smoke of their torment doth go up to ages of ages; and they have no rest day and night, who are bowing before the beast and his image, also if any doth receive the mark of his name."
"66014012","66","14","12","Here is endurance of the saints: here `are' those keeping the commands of God, and the faith of Jesus.'"
"66014013","66","14","13","And I heard a voice out of the heaven saying to me, `Write: Happy are the dead who in the Lord are dying from this time!' `Yes, (saith the Spirit,) That they may rest from their labours -- and their works do follow them!'"
"66014014","66","14","14","And I saw, and lo, a white cloud, and upon the cloud `one' sitting like to a son of man, having upon his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle;"
"66014015","66","14","15","and another messenger did come forth out of the sanctuary crying in a great voice to him who is sitting upon the cloud, `Send forth thy sickle and reap, because come to thee hath the hour of reaping, because ripe hath been the harvest of the earth;'"
"66014016","66","14","16","and he who is sitting upon the cloud did put forth his sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped."
"66014017","66","14","17","And another messenger did come forth out of the sanctuary that `is' in the heaven, having -- he also -- a sharp sickle,"
"66014018","66","14","18","and another messenger did come forth out from the altar, having authority over the fire, and he called with a great cry to him having the sharp sickle, saying, `Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, because come to perfection have her grapes;'"
"66014019","66","14","19","and the messenger did put forth his sickle to the earth, and did gather the vine of the earth, and did cast `it' to the great wine-press of the wrath of God;"
"66014020","66","14","20","and trodden was the wine-press outside of the city, and blood did come forth out of the wine-press -- unto the bridles of the horses, a thousand, six hundred furlongs."
"66015001","66","15","1","And I saw another sign in the heaven, great and wonderful, seven messengers having the seven last plagues, because in these was completed the wrath of God,"
"66015002","66","15","2","and I saw as a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who do gain the victory over the beast, and his image, and his mark, `and' the number of his name, standing by the sea of the glass, having harps of God,"
"66015003","66","15","3","and they sing the song of Moses, servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, `Great and wonderful `are' Thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty, righteous and true `are' Thy ways, O King of saints,"
"66015004","66","15","4","who may not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? because Thou alone `art' kind, because all the nations shall come and bow before Thee, because Thy righteous acts were manifested.'"
"66015005","66","15","5","And after these things I saw, and lo, opened was the sanctuary of the tabernacle of the testimony in the heaven;"
"66015006","66","15","6","and come forth did the seven messengers having the seven plagues, out of the sanctuary, clothed in linen, pure and shining, and girded round the breasts with golden girdles:"
"66015007","66","15","7","and one of the four living creatures did give to the seven messengers seven golden vials, full of the wrath of God, who is living to the ages of the ages;"
"66015008","66","15","8","and filled was the sanctuary with smoke from the glory of God, and from His power, and no one was able to enter into the sanctuary till the seven plagues of the seven messengers may be finished."
"66016001","66","16","1","And I heard a great voice out of the sanctuary saying to the seven messengers, `Go away, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God to the earth;'"
"66016002","66","16","2","and the first did go away, and did pour out his vial upon the land, and there came a sore -- bad and grievous -- to men, those having the mark of the beast, and those bowing to his image."
"66016003","66","16","3","And the second messenger did pour out his vial to the sea, and there came blood as of `one' dead, and every living soul died in the sea."
"66016004","66","16","4","And the third messenger did pour out his vial to the rivers, and to the fountains of the waters, and there came blood,"
"66016005","66","16","5","and I heard the messenger of the waters, saying, `righteous, O Lord, art Thou, who art, and who wast, and who shalt be, because these things Thou didst judge,"
"66016006","66","16","6","because blood of saints and prophets they did pour out, and blood to them Thou didst give to drink, for they are worthy;'"
"66016007","66","16","7","and I heard another out of the altar, saying, `Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous `are' Thy judgments.'"
"66016008","66","16","8","And the fourth messenger did pour out his vial upon the sun, and there was given to him to scorch men with fire,"
"66016009","66","16","9","and men were scorched with great heat, and they did speak evil of the name of God, who hath authority over these plagues, and they did not reform -- to give to Him glory."
"66016010","66","16","10","And the fifth messenger did pour out his vial upon the throne of the beast, and his kingdom did become darkened, and they were gnawing their tongues from the pain,"
"66016011","66","16","11","and they did speak evil of the God of the heaven, from their pains, and from their sores, and they did not reform from their works."
"66016012","66","16","12","And the sixth messenger did pour out his vial upon the great river, the Euphrates, and dried up was its water, that the way of the kings who are from the rising of the sun may be made ready;"
"66016013","66","16","13","and I saw `come' out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs --"
"66016014","66","16","14","for they are spirits of demons, doing signs -- which go forth unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to bring them together to the battle of that great day of God the Almighty; --"
"66016015","66","16","15","`lo, I do come as a thief; happy `is' he who is watching, and keeping his garments, that he may not walk naked, and they may see his unseemliness,' --"
"66016016","66","16","16","and they did bring them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Armageddon."
"66016017","66","16","17","And the seventh messenger did pour out his vial to the air, and there came forth a great voice from the sanctuary of the heaven, from the throne, saying, `It hath come!'"
"66016018","66","16","18","and there came voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and a great earthquake came, such as came not since men came upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake -- so great!"
"66016019","66","16","19","And it came -- the great city -- into three parts, and the cities of the nations did fall, and Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the wrath of His anger,"
"66016020","66","16","20","and every island did flee away, and mountains were not found,"
"66016021","66","16","21","and great hail (as of talent weight) doth come down out of the heaven upon men, and men did speak evil of God because of the plague of the hail, because its plague is very great."
"66017001","66","17","1","And there came one of the seven messengers, who were having the seven vials, and he spake with me, saying to me, `Come, I will shew to thee the judgment of the great whore, who is sitting upon the many waters,"
"66017002","66","17","2","with whom the kings of the earth did commit whoredom; and made drunk from the wine of her whoredom were those inhabiting the earth;'"
"66017003","66","17","3","and he carried me away to a wilderness in the Spirit, and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-coloured beast, full of names of evil-speaking, having seven heads and ten horns,"
"66017004","66","17","4","and the woman was arrayed with purple and scarlet-colour, and gilded with gold, and precious stone, and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and uncleanness of her whoredom,"
"66017005","66","17","5","and upon her forehead was a name written: `Secret, Babylon the Great, the Mother of the Whores, and the Abominations of the earth.'"
"66017006","66","17","6","And I saw the woman drunken from the blood of the saints, and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus, and I did wonder -- having seen her -- with great wonder;"
"66017007","66","17","7","and the messenger said to me, `Wherefore didst thou wonder? I -- I will tell thee the secret of the woman and of the beast that `is' carrying her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns."
"66017008","66","17","8","`The beast that thou didst see: it was, and it is not; and it is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go away to destruction, and wonder shall those dwelling upon the earth, whose names have not been written upon the scroll of the life from the foundation of the world, beholding the beast that was, and is not, although it is."
"66017009","66","17","9","`Here `is' the mind that is having wisdom; the seven heads are seven mountains, upon which the woman doth sit,"
"66017010","66","17","10","and there are seven kings, the five did fall, and the one is, the other did not yet come, and when he may come, it behoveth him to remain a little time;"
"66017011","66","17","11","and the beast that was, and is not, he also is eighth, and out of the seven he is, and to destruction he doth go away."
"66017012","66","17","12","`And the ten horns that thou sawest, are ten kings, who a kingdom did not yet receive, but authority as kings the same hour do receive with the beast,"
"66017013","66","17","13","these have one mind, and their own power and authority to the beast they shall give over;"
"66017014","66","17","14","these with the Lamb shall make war, and the Lamb shall overcome them, because Lord of lords he is, and King of kings, and those with him are called, and choice, and stedfast.'"
"66017015","66","17","15","And he saith to me, `The waters that thou didst see, where the whore doth sit, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues;'"
"66017016","66","17","16","and the ten horns that thou didst see upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her in fire,"
"66017017","66","17","17","for God did give into their hearts to do its mind, and to make one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast till the sayings of God may be complete,"
"66017018","66","17","18","and the woman that thou didst see is the great city that is having reign over the kings of the land.'"
"66018001","66","18","1","And after these things I saw another messenger coming down out of the heaven, having great authority, and the earth was lightened from his glory,"
"66018002","66","18","2","and he did cry in might -- a great voice, saying, `Fall, fall did Babylon the great, and she became a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird,"
"66018003","66","18","3","because of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom have all the nations drunk, and the kings of the earth with her did commit whoredom, and merchants of the earth from the power of her revel were made rich."
"66018004","66","18","4","And I heard another voice out of the heaven, saying, `Come forth out of her, My people, that ye may not partake with her sins, and that ye may not receive of her plagues,"
"66018005","66","18","5","because her sins did follow -- unto the heaven, and God did remember her unrighteousness."
"66018006","66","18","6","Render to her as also she did render to you, and double to her doubles according to her works; in the cup that she did mingle mingle to her double."
"66018007","66","18","7","`As much as she did glorify herself and did revel, so much torment and sorrow give to her, because in her heart she saith, I sit a queen, and a widow I am not, and sorrow I shall not see;"
"66018008","66","18","8","because of this, in one day, shall come her plagues, death, and sorrow, and famine; and in fire she shall be utterly burned, because strong `is' the Lord God who is judging her;"
"66018009","66","18","9","and weep over her, and smite themselves for her, shall the kings of the earth, who with her did commit whoredom and did revel, when they may see the smoke of her burning,"
"66018010","66","18","10","from afar having stood because of the fear of her torment, saying, Wo, wo, the great city! Babylon, the strong city! because in one hour did come thy judgment."
"66018011","66","18","11","`And the merchants of the earth shall weep and sorrow over her, because their lading no one doth buy any more;"
"66018012","66","18","12","lading of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyne wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel of most precious wood, and brass, and iron, and marble,"
"66018013","66","18","13","and cinnamon, and odours, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and of horses, and of chariots, and of bodies and souls of men."
"66018014","66","18","14","`And the fruits of the desire of thy soul did go away from thee, and all things -- the dainty and the bright -- did go away from thee, and no more at all mayest thou find them."
"66018015","66","18","15","The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, far off shall stand because of the fear of her torment, weeping, and sorrowing,"
"66018016","66","18","16","and saying, Wo, wo, the great city, that was arrayed with fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and gilded in gold, and precious stone, and pearls -- because in one hour so much riches were made waste!"
"66018017","66","18","17","`And every shipmaster, and all the company upon the ships, and sailors, and as many as work the sea, far off stood,"
"66018018","66","18","18","and were crying, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What `city is' like to the great city?"
"66018019","66","18","19","and they did cast dust upon their heads, and were crying out, weeping and sorrowing, saying, Wo, wo, the great city! in which were made rich all having ships in the sea, out of her costliness -- for in one hour was she made waste."
"66018020","66","18","20","`Be glad over her, O heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets, because God did judge your judgment of her!'"
"66018021","66","18","21","And one strong messenger did take up a stone as a great millstone, and did cast `it' to the sea, saying, `Thus with violence shall Babylon be cast, the great city, and may not be found any more at all;"
"66018022","66","18","22","and voice of harpers, and musicians, and pipers, and trumpeters, may not be heard at all in thee any more; and any artizan of any art may not be found at all in thee any more; and noise of a millstone may not be heard at all in thee any more;"
"66018023","66","18","23","and light of a lamp may not shine at all in thee any more; and voice of bridegroom and of bride may not be heard at all in thee any more; because thy merchants were the great ones of the earth, because in thy sorcery were all the nations led astray,"
"66018024","66","18","24","and in her blood of prophets and of saints was found, and of all those who have been slain on the earth.'"
"66019001","66","19","1","And after these things I heard a great voice of a great multitude in the heaven, saying, `Alleluia! the salvation, and the glory, and the honour, and the power, `is' to the Lord our God;"
"66019002","66","19","2","because true and righteous `are' His judgments, because He did judge the great whore who did corrupt the earth in her whoredom, and He did avenge the blood of His servants at her hand;'"
"66019003","66","19","3","and a second time they said, `Alleluia;' and her smoke doth come up -- to the ages of the ages!"
"66019004","66","19","4","And fall down did the elders -- the twenty and four -- and the four living creatures, and they did bow before God who is sitting upon the throne, saying, `Amen, Alleluia.'"
"66019005","66","19","5","And a voice out of the throne did come forth, saying, `Praise our God, all ye His servants, and those fearing Him, both the small and the great;'"
"66019006","66","19","6","and I heard as the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, `Alleluia! because reign did the Lord God -- the Almighty!"
"66019007","66","19","7","may we rejoice and exult, and give the glory to Him, because come did the marriage of the Lamb, and his wife did make herself ready;"
"66019008","66","19","8","and there was given to her that she may be arrayed with fine linen, pure and shining, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.'"
"66019009","66","19","9","And he saith to me, `Write: Happy `are' they who to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb have been called;' and he saith to me, `These `are' the true words of God;'"
"66019010","66","19","10","and I fell before his feet, to bow before him, and he saith to me, `See -- not! fellow servant of thee am I, and of thy brethren, those having the testimony of Jesus; bow before God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy.'"
"66019011","66","19","11","And I saw the heaven having been opened, and lo, a white horse, and he who is sitting upon it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness doth he judge and war,"
"66019012","66","19","12","and his eyes `are' as a flame of fire, and upon his head `are' many diadems -- having a name written that no one hath known, except himself,"
"66019013","66","19","13","and he is arrayed with a garment covered with blood, and his name is called, The Word of God."
"66019014","66","19","14","And the armies in the heaven were following him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen -- white and pure;"
"66019015","66","19","15","and out of his mouth doth proceed a sharp sword, that with it he may smite the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and he doth tread the press of the wine of the wrath and the anger of God the Almighty,"
"66019016","66","19","16","and he hath upon the garment and upon his thigh the name written, `King of kings, and Lord of lords.'"
"66019017","66","19","17","And I saw one messenger standing in the sun, and he cried, a great voice, saying to all the birds that are flying in mid-heaven, `Come and be gathered together to the supper of the great God,"
"66019018","66","19","18","that ye may eat flesh of kings, and flesh of chiefs of thousands, and flesh of strong men, and flesh of horses, and of those sitting on them, and the flesh of all -- freemen and servants -- both small and great.'"
"66019019","66","19","19","And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, having been gathered together to make war with him who is sitting upon the horse, and with his army;"
"66019020","66","19","20","and the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who did the signs before him, in which he led astray those who did receive the mark of the beast, and those who did bow before his image; living they were cast -- the two -- to the lake of the fire, that is burning with brimstone;"
"66019021","66","19","21","and the rest were killed with the sword of him who is sitting on the horse, which `sword' is proceeding out of his mouth, and all the birds were filled out of their flesh."
"66020001","66","20","1","And I saw a messenger coming down out of the heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain over his hand,"
"66020002","66","20","2","and he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, who is Devil and Adversary, and did bind him a thousand years,"
"66020003","66","20","3","and he cast him to the abyss, and did shut him up, and put a seal upon him, that he may not lead astray the nations any more, till the thousand years may be finished; and after these it behoveth him to be loosed a little time."
"66020004","66","20","4","And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them, and the souls of those who have been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus, and because of the word of God, and who did not bow before the beast, nor his image, and did not receive the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand, and they did live and reign with Christ the thousand years;"
"66020005","66","20","5","and the rest of the dead did not live again till the thousand years may be finished; this `is' the first rising again."
"66020006","66","20","6","Happy and holy `is' he who is having part in the first rising again; over these the second death hath not authority, but they shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years."
"66020007","66","20","7","And when the thousand years may be finished, the Adversary shall be loosed out of his prison,"
"66020008","66","20","8","and he shall go forth to lead the nations astray, that are in the four corners of the earth -- Gog and Magog -- to gather them together to war, of whom the number `is' as the sand of the sea;"
"66020009","66","20","9","and they did go up over the breadth of the land, and did surround the camp of the saints, and the beloved city, and there came down fire from God out of the heaven, and devoured them;"
"66020010","66","20","10","and the Devil, who is leading them astray, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where `are' the beast and the false prophet, and they shall be tormented day and night -- to the ages of the ages."
"66020011","66","20","11","And I saw a great white throne, and Him who is sitting upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven did flee away, and place was not found for them;"
"66020012","66","20","12","and I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and scrolls were opened, and another scroll was opened, which is that of the life, and the dead were judged out of the things written in the scrolls -- according to their works;"
"66020013","66","20","13","and the sea did give up those dead in it, and the death and the hades did give up the dead in them, and they were judged, each one according to their works;"
"66020014","66","20","14","and the death and the hades were cast to the lake of the fire -- this `is' the second death;"
"66020015","66","20","15","and if any one was not found written in the scroll of the life, he was cast to the lake of the fire."
"66021001","66","21","1","And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth did pass away, and the sea is not any more;"
"66021002","66","21","2","and I, John, saw the holy city -- new Jerusalem -- coming down from God out of the heaven, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband;"
"66021003","66","21","3","and I heard a great voice out of the heaven, saying, `Lo, the tabernacle of God `is' with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they shall be His peoples, and God Himself shall be with them -- their God,"
"66021004","66","21","4","and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes, and the death shall not be any more, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor shall there be any more pain, because the first things did go away.'"
"66021005","66","21","5","And He who is sitting upon the throne said, `Lo, new I make all things; and He saith to me, `Write, because these words are true and stedfast;'"
"66021006","66","21","6","and He said to me, `It hath been done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End; I, to him who is thirsting, will give of the fountain of the water of the life freely;"
"66021007","66","21","7","he who is overcoming shall inherit all things, and I will be to him -- a God, and he shall be to me -- the son,"
"66021008","66","21","8","and to fearful, and unstedfast, and abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all the liars, their part `is' in the lake that is burning with fire and brimstone, which is a second death.'"
"66021009","66","21","9","And there came unto me one of the seven messengers, who have the seven vials that are full of the seven last plagues, and he spake with me, saying, `Come, I will shew thee the bride of the Lamb -- the wife,'"
"66021010","66","21","10","and he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and did shew to me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God,"
"66021011","66","21","11","having the glory of God, and her light `is' like a stone most precious, as a jasper stone clear as crystal,"
"66021012","66","21","12","having also a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve messengers, and names written thereon, which are `those' of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel,"
"66021013","66","21","13","at the east three gates, at the north three gates, at the south three gates, at the west three gates;"
"66021014","66","21","14","and the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
"66021015","66","21","15","And he who is speaking with me had a golden reed, that he may measure the city, and its gates, and its wall;"
"66021016","66","21","16","and the city lieth square, and the length of it is as great as the breadth; and he did measure the city with the reed -- furlongs twelve thousand; the length, and the breadth, and the height, of it are equal;"
"66021017","66","21","17","and he measured its wall, an hundred forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, that is, of the messenger;"
"66021018","66","21","18","and the building of its wall was jasper, and the city `is' pure gold -- like to pure glass;"
"66021019","66","21","19","and the foundations of the wall of the city with every precious stone have been adorned; the first foundation jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;"
"66021020","66","21","20","the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst."
"66021021","66","21","21","And the twelve gates `are' twelve pearls, each several one of the gates was of one pearl; and the broad-place of the city `is' pure gold -- as transparent glass."
"66021022","66","21","22","And a sanctuary I did not see in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, is its sanctuary, and the Lamb,"
"66021023","66","21","23","and the city hath no need of the sun, nor of the moon, that they may shine in it; for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp of it `is' the Lamb;"
"66021024","66","21","24","and the nations of the saved in its light shall walk, and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it,"
"66021025","66","21","25","and its gates shall not at all be shut by day, for night shall not be there;"
"66021026","66","21","26","and they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations into it;"
"66021027","66","21","27","and there may not at all enter into it any thing defiling and doing abomination, and a lie, but -- those written in the scroll of the life of the Lamb."
"66022001","66","22","1","And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, bright as crystal, going forth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb:"
"66022002","66","22","2","in the midst of its broad place, and of the river on this side and on that, `is' a tree of life, yielding twelve fruits, in each several month rendering its fruits, and the leaves of the tree `are' for the service of the nations;"
"66022003","66","22","3","and any curse there shall not be any more, and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him,"
"66022004","66","22","4","and they shall see His face, and His name `is' upon their foreheads,"
"66022005","66","22","5","and night shall not be there, and they have no need of a lamp and light of a sun, because the Lord God doth give them light, and they shall reign -- to the ages of the ages."
"66022006","66","22","6","And he said to me, `These words `are' stedfast and true, and the Lord God of the holy prophets did send His messenger to shew to His servants the things that it behoveth to come quickly:"
"66022007","66","22","7","Lo, I come quickly; happy `is' he who is keeping the words of the prophecy of this scroll.'"
"66022008","66","22","8","And I, John, am he who is seeing these things and hearing, and when I heard and beheld, I fell down to bow before the feet of the messenger who is shewing me these things;"
"66022009","66","22","9","and he saith to me, `See -- not; for fellow-servant of thee am I, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of those keeping the words of this scroll; before God bow.'"
"66022010","66","22","10","And he saith to me, `Thou mayest not seal the words of the prophecy of this scroll, because the time is nigh;"
"66022011","66","22","11","he who is unrighteous -- let him be unrighteous still, and he who is filthy -- let him be filthy still, and he who is righteous -- let him be declared righteous still, and he who is sanctified -- let him be sanctified still:"
"66022012","66","22","12","And lo, I come quickly, and my reward `is' with me, to render to each as his work shall be;"
"66022013","66","22","13","I am the Alpha and the Omega -- the Beginning and End -- the First and the Last."
"66022014","66","22","14","`Happy are those doing His commands that the authority shall be theirs unto the tree of the life, and by the gates they may enter into the city;"
"66022015","66","22","15","and without `are' the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the whoremongers, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one who is loving and is doing a lie."
"66022016","66","22","16","`I, Jesus did send my messenger to testify to you these things concerning the assemblies; I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright and morning star!"
"66022017","66","22","17","And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come; and he who is hearing -- let him say, Come; and he who is thirsting -- let him come; and he who is willing -- let him take the water of life freely."
"66022018","66","22","18","`For I testify to every one hearing the words of the prophecy of this scroll, if any one may add unto these, God shall add to him the plagues that have been written in this scroll,"
"66022019","66","22","19","and if any one may take away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the scroll of the life, and out of the holy city, and the things that have been written in this scroll;'"
"66022020","66","22","20","he saith -- who is testifying these things -- `Yes, I come quickly!' Amen! Yes, be coming, Lord Jesus!"
"66022021","66","22","21","The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ `is' with you all. Amen."
