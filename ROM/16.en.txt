And I commend you to Phebe our sister -- being a ministrant of the assembly that `is' in Cenchrea --"
that ye may receive her in the Lord
Salute Priscilla and Aquilas
who for my life their own neck did lay down
and the assembly at their house; salute Epaenetus
Salute Mary
salute Andronicus and Junias
Salute Amplias
salute Arbanus
salute Apelles
salute Herodion
salute Tryphaena
Salute Rufus
salute Asyncritus
salute Philologus
salute one another in a holy kiss; the assemblies of Christ do salute you."
And I call upon you
for such our Lord Jesus Christ do not serve
for your obedience did reach to all; I rejoice
and the God of the peace shall bruise the Adversary under your feet quickly; the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ `be' with you. Amen!"
Salute you do Timotheus
I Tertius salute you (who wrote the letter) in the Lord;"
salute you doth Gaius
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ `be' with you all. Amen."
And to Him who is able to establish you
and now having been made manifest
to the only wise God
