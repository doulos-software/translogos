Having been declared righteous
through whom also we have the access by the faith into this grace in which we have stood
And not only `so'
and the endurance
and the hope doth not make ashamed
For in our being still ailing
for scarcely for a righteous man will any one die
and God doth commend His own love to us
much more
for if
And not only `so'
because of this
for till law sin was in the world: and sin is not reckoned when there is not law;"
but the death did reign from Adam till Moses
But
and not as through one who did sin `is' the free gift
for if by the offence of the one the death did reign through the one
So
for as through the disobedience of the one man
And law came in
that even as the sin did reign in the death
