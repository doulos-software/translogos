What
much in every way; for first
for what
let it not be! and let God become true
And
let it not be! since how shall God judge the world?"
for if the truth of God in my falsehood did more abound to His glory
and not
What
according as it hath been written -- `There is none righteous
There is none who is understanding
All did go out of the way
A sepulchre opened `is' their throat; with their tongues they used deceit; poison of asps `is' under their lips."
Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness."
Swift `are' their feet to shed blood."
Ruin and misery `are' in their ways."
And a way of peace they did not know."
There is no fear of God before their eyes.'"
And we have known that as many things as the law saith
wherefore by works of law shall no flesh be declared righteous before Him
And now apart from law hath the righteousness of God been manifested
and the righteousness of God `is' through the faith of Jesus Christ to all
for all did sin
being declared righteous freely by His grace through the redemption that `is' in Christ Jesus
whom God did set forth a mercy seat
for the shewing forth of His righteousness in the present time
Where then `is' the boasting? it was excluded; by what law? of works? no
therefore do we reckon a man to be declared righteous by faith
The God of Jews only `is He'
yes
Law then do we make useless through the faith? let it not be! yea
