Truth I say in Christ
that I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart --"
for I was wishing
who are Israelites
whose `are' the fathers
And it is not possible that the word of God hath failed; for not all who `are' of Israel are these Israel;"
nor because they are seed of Abraham `are' all children
that is
for the word of promise `is' this; `According to this time I will come
And not only `so'
(for they being not yet born
`The greater shall serve the less;'"
according as it hath been written
What
for to Moses He saith
so
for the Writing saith to Pharaoh -- `For this very thing I did raise thee up
so
Thou wilt say
nay
hath not the potter authority over the clay
And if God
and that He might make known the riches of His glory on vessels of kindness
not only out of Jews
as also in Hosea He saith
and it shall be -- in the place where it was said to them
And Isaiah doth cry concerning Israel
for a matter He is finishing
and according as Isaiah saith before
What
and Israel
wherefore? because -- not by faith
according as it hath been written
