Brethren
for I bear them testimony that they have a zeal of God
for not knowing the righteousness of God
For Christ is an end of law for righteousness to every one who is believing
for Moses doth describe the righteousness that `is' of the law
and the righteousness of faith doth thus speak: `Thou mayest not say in thine heart
or
But what doth it say? `Nigh thee is the saying -- in thy mouth
that if thou mayest confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
for with the heart doth `one' believe to righteousness
for the Writing saith
for there is no difference between Jew and Greek
for every one -- whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord
How then shall they call upon `him' in whom they did not believe? and how shall they believe `on him' of whom they did not hear? and how shall they hear apart from one preaching?"
and how shall they preach
But they were not all obedient to the good tidings
so then the faith `is' by a report
but I say
But I say
and Isaiah is very bold
and unto Israel He saith
