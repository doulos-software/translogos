And him who is weak in the faith receive ye -- not to determinations of reasonings;"
one doth believe that he may eat all things -- and he who is weak doth eat herbs;"
let not him who is eating despise him who is not eating: and let not him who is not eating judge him who is eating
Thou -- who art thou that art judging another's domestic? to his own master he doth stand or fall; and he shall be made to stand
One doth judge one day above another
He who is regarding the day
For none of us to himself doth live
for both
for because of this Christ both died and rose again
And thou
for it hath been written
so
no longer
I have known
and if through victuals thy brother is grieved
Let not
for the reign of God is not eating and drinking
for he who in these things is serving the Christ
So
for the sake of victuals cast not down the work of God; all things
Right `it is' not to eat flesh
Thou hast faith! to thyself have `it' before God; happy is he who is not judging himself in what he doth approve
and he who is making a difference
