or ministration -- `In the ministration!' or he who is teaching -- `In the teaching!'"
or he who is exhorting -- `In the exhortation!' he who is sharing -- `In simplicity!' he who is leading -- `In diligence?' he who is doing kindness -- `In cheerfulness.'"

in the hope rejoicing; in the tribulation enduring; in the prayer persevering;"

to rejoice with the rejoicing
of the same mind one toward another
giving back to no one evil for evil; providing right things before all men."
If possible -- so far as in you -- with all men being in peace;"
not avenging yourselves
I will recompense again
Be not overcome by the evil
