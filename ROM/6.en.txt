What
let it not be! we who died to the sin -- how shall we still live in it?"
are ye ignorant that we
we were buried together
For
this knowing
for he who hath died hath been set free from the sin."
And if we died with Christ
knowing that Christ
for in that he died
so also ye
Let not then the sin reign in your mortal body
neither present ye your members instruments of unrighteousness to the sin
for sin over you shall not have lordship
What then? shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? let it not be!"
have ye not known that to whom ye present yourselves servants for obedience
and thanks to God
and having been freed from the sin
In the manner of men I speak
for when ye were servants of the sin
what fruit
And now
for the wages of the sin `is' death
