Paul
which He announced before through His prophets in holy writings --"
concerning His Son
who is marked out Son of God in power
through whom we did receive grace and apostleship
among whom are also ye
to all who are in Rome
first
for God is my witness
always in my prayers beseeching
for I long to see you
and that is
And I do not wish you to be ignorant
Both to Greeks and to foreigners
so
for I am not ashamed of the good news of the Christ
For the righteousness of God in it is revealed from faith to faith
for revealed is the wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety and unrighteousness of men
Because that which is known of God is manifest among them
for the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world
because
professing to be wise
and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man
Wherefore also God did give them up
who did change the truth of God into a falsehood
Because of this did God give them up to dishonourable affections
and in like manner also the males having left the natural use of the female
And
having been filled with all unrighteousness
evil-speakers
unintelligent
who the righteous judgment of God having known -- that those practising such things are worthy of death -- not only do them
