And we ought -- we who are strong -- to bear the infirmities of the weak
for let each one of us please the neighbor for good
for even the Christ did not please himself
for
And may the God of the endurance
that with one accord -- with one mouth -- ye may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
wherefore receive ye one another
And I say Jesus Christ to have become a ministrant of circumcision for the truth of God
and the nations for kindness to glorify God
and again it saith
and again
and again
and the God of the hope shall fill you with all joy and peace in the believing
And I am persuaded
and the more boldly I did write to you
for my being a servant of Jesus Christ to the nations
I have
for I will not dare to speak anything of the things that Christ did not work through me
in power of signs and wonders
and so counting it honour to proclaim good news
but according as it hath been written
Wherefore
and now
when I may go on to Spain I will come unto you
And
for it pleased Macedonia and Achaia well to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who `are' in Jerusalem;"
for it pleased well
This
and I have known that coming unto you -- in the fulness of the blessing of the good news of Christ I shall come."
And I call upon you
that I may be delivered from those not believing in Judea
that in joy I may come unto you
and the God of the peace `be' with you all. Amen."
