Let every soul to the higher authorities be subject
so that he who is setting himself against the authority
For those ruling are not a terror to the good works
for of God it is a ministrant to thee for good; and if that which is evil thou mayest do
Wherefore it is necessary to be subject
for because of this also pay ye tribute; for servants of God they are
render
To no one owe anything
for
the love to the neighbor doth work no ill; the love
And this
the night did advance
as in day-time
but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ
