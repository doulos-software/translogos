Therefore
and we have known that the judgment of God is according to truth
And dost thou think this
or the riches of His goodness
but
who shall render to each according to his works;"
to those
and to those contentious
tribulation and distress
and glory
For there is no acceptance of faces with God
for as many as without law did sin
for not the hearers of the law `are' righteous before God
For
who do shew the work of the law written in their hearts
in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men
Lo
and dost know the will
and hast confidence that thou thyself art a leader of blind ones
an instructor of foolish ones
Thou
thou who art preaching not to steal
thou who in the law dost boast
for the name of God because of you is evil spoken of among the nations
For circumcision
If
and the uncircumcision
For he is not a Jew who is `so' outwardly
but a Jew `is' he who is `so' inwardly
