Followers of me become ye
And I praise you
and I wish you to know that of every man the head is the Christ
Every man praying or prophesying
and every woman praying or prophesying with the head uncovered
for if a woman is not covered -- then let her be shorn
for a man
for a man is not of a woman
for a man also was not created because of the woman
because of this the woman ought to have `a token of' authority upon the head
but neither `is' a man apart from a woman
for as the woman `is' of the man
In your own selves judge ye; is it seemly for a woman uncovered to pray to God?"
doth not even nature itself teach you
and a woman
and if any one doth think to be contentious
And this declaring
for first
for it behoveth sects also to be among you
ye
for each his own supper doth take before in the eating
why
For I -- I received from the Lord that which also I did deliver to you
and having given thanks
In like manner also the cup after the supping
for as often as ye may eat this bread
so that whoever may eat this bread or may drink the cup of the Lord unworthily
and let a man be proving himself
for he who is eating and drinking unworthily
Because of this
for if ourselves we were discerning
and being judged by the Lord
so then
and if any one is hungry
