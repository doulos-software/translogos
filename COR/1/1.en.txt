Paul
to the assembly of God that is in Corinth
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
I give thanks to my God always concerning you for the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus
that in every thing ye were enriched in him
according as the testimony of the Christ was confirmed in you
so that ye are not behind in any gift
who also shall confirm you unto the end -- unblamable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
faithful `is' God
And I call upon you
for it was signified to me concerning you
and I say this
Hath the Christ been divided? was Paul crucified for you? or to the name of Paul were ye baptized;"
I give thanks to God that no one of you did I baptize
that no one may say that to my own name I did baptize;"
and I did baptize also Stephanas' household -- further
For Christ did not send me to baptize
for the word of the cross to those indeed perishing is foolishness
for it hath been written
where `is' the wise? where the scribe? where a disputer of this age? did not God make foolish the wisdom of this world?"
for
Since also Jews ask a sign
also we -- we preach Christ crucified
and to those called -- both Jews and Greeks -- Christ the power of God
because the foolishness of God is wiser than men
for see your calling
but the foolish things of the world did God choose
and the base things of the world
that no flesh may glory before Him;"
and of Him ye -- ye are in Christ Jesus
that
