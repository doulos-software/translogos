And concerning the things of which ye wrote to me: good `it is' for a man not to touch a woman
and because of the whoredom let each man have his own wife
to the wife let the husband the due benevolence render
the wife over her own body hath not authority
Defraud not one another
and this I say by way of concurrence -- not of command
for I wish all men to be even as I myself `am'; but each his own gift hath of God
And I say to the unmarried and to the widows: it is good for them if they may remain even as I `am';"
and if they have not continence -- let them marry
and to the married I announce -- not I
but and if she may separate
And to the rest I speak -- not the Lord -- if any brother hath a wife unbelieving
and a woman who hath a husband unbelieving
for the unbelieving husband hath been sanctified in the wife
And
for what
if not
being circumcised -- was any one called? let him not become uncircumcised; in uncircumcision was any one called? let him not be circumcised;"
the circumcision is nothing
Each in the calling in which he was called -- in this let him remain;"
a servant -- wast thou called? be not anxious; but if also thou art able to become free -- use `it' rather;"
for he who `is' in the Lord -- having been called a servant -- is the Lord's freedman: in like manner also he the freeman
with a price ye were bought
each
And concerning the virgins
I suppose
Hast thou been bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed; hast thou been loosed from a wife? seek not a wife."
But and if thou mayest marry
And this I say
and those weeping
and those using this world
And I wish you to be without anxiety; the unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord
and the married is anxious for the things of the world
The wife and the virgin have been distinguished: the unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord
And this for your own profit I say: not that I may cast a noose upon you
and if any one doth think `it' to be unseemly to his virgin
And he who hath stood stedfast in the heart -- not having necessity -- and hath authority over his own will
so that both he who is giving in marriage doth well
A wife hath been bound by law as long time as her husband may live
and she is happier if she may so remain -- according to my judgment; and I think I also have the Spirit of God."
