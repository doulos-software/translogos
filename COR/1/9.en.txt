Am not I an apostle? am not I free? Jesus Christ our Lord have I not seen? my work are not ye in the Lord?"
if to others I am not an apostle -- yet doubtless to you I am; for the seal of my apostleship are ye in the Lord."
My defence to those who examine me in this;"
have we not authority to eat and to drink?"
have we not authority a sister -- a wife -- to lead about
or only I and Barnabas
who doth serve as a soldier at his own charges at any time? who doth plant a vineyard
According to man do I speak these things? or doth not also the law say these things?"
for in the law of Moses it hath been written
or because of us by all means doth He say `it'? yes
If we to you the spiritual things did sow -- great `is it' if we your fleshly things do reap?"
if others do partake of the authority over you -- not we more? but we did not use this authority
Have ye not known that those working about the things of the temple -- of the temple do eat
so also did the Lord direct to those proclaiming the good news: of the good news to live."
And I have used none of these things; neither did I write these things that it may be so done in my case
for if I may proclaim good news
for if willing I do this
What
for being free from all men
and I became to the Jews as a Jew
to those without law
I became to the infirm as infirm
And this I do because of the good news
have ye not known that those running in a race -- all indeed run
and every one who is striving
I
but I chastise my body
