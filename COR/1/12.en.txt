And concerning the spiritual things
ye have known that ye were nations
wherefore
And there are diversities of gifts
and there are diversities of ministrations
and there are diversities of workings
And to each hath been given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit;"
for to one through the Spirit hath been given a word of wisdom
and to another faith in the same Spirit
and to another in-workings of mighty deeds; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; and to another `divers' kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues:"
and all these doth work the one and the same Spirit
For
for also in one Spirit we all to one body were baptized
for also the body is not one member
if the foot may say
and if the ear may say
If the whole body `were' an eye
and now
and if all were one member
and now
and an eye is not able to say to the hand
But much more the members of the body which seem to be more infirm are necessary
and those that we think to be less honourable of the body
and our seemly things have no need; but God did temper the body together
that there may be no division in the body
and whether one member doth suffer
and ye are the body of Christ
And some
`are' all apostles? `are' all prophets? `are' all teachers? `are' all powers?"
have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?"
and desire earnestly the better gifts; and yet a far excelling way do I shew to you:"
