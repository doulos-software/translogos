Whoredom is actually heard of among you
and ye are having been puffed up
for I indeed
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ -- ye being gathered together
to deliver up such a one to the Adversary for the destruction of the flesh
Not good `is' your glorying; have ye not known that a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven?"
cleanse out
so that we may keep the feast
I did write to you in the epistle
and not certainly with the whoremongers of this world
and now
for what have I also those without to judge? those within do ye not judge?"
and those without God doth judge; and put ye away the evil from among yourselves."
