And I do not wish you to be ignorant
and all to Moses were baptized in the cloud
and all the same spiritual food did eat
and all the same spiritual drink did drink
but in the most of them God was not well pleased
and those things became types of us
Neither become ye idolaters
neither may we commit whoredom
neither may we tempt the Christ
neither murmur ye
And all these things as types did happen to those persons
so that he who is thinking to stand -- let him observe
No temptation hath taken you -- except human; and God is faithful
Wherefore
as to wise men I speak -- judge ye what I say:"
The cup of the blessing that we bless -- is it not the fellowship of the blood of the Christ? the bread that we break -- is it not the fellowship of the body of the Christ?"
because one bread
See Israel according to the flesh! are not those eating the sacrifices in the fellowship of the altar?"
what then do I say? that an idol is anything? or that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything? --"
`no
Ye are not able the cup of the Lord to drink
do we arouse the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than He?"
All things to me are lawful
let no one seek his own -- but each another's."
Whatever in the meat-market is sold eat ye
for the Lord's `is' the earth
and if any one of the unbelieving do call you
and if any one may say to you
and conscience
and if I thankfully do partake
Whether
become offenceless
as I also in all things do please all
