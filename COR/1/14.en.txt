Pursue the love
for he who is speaking in an `unknown' tongue -- to men he doth not speak
and he who is prophesying to men doth speak edification
he who is speaking in an `unknown' tongue
and I wish you all to speak with tongues
And now
yet the things without life giving sound -- whether pipe or harp -- if a difference in the sounds they may not give
for if also an uncertain sound a trumpet may give
so also ye
There are
if
so also ye
wherefore he who is speaking in an `unknown' tongue -- let him pray that he may interpret;"
for if I pray in an `unknown' tongue
What then is it? I will pray with the spirit
since
for thou
I give thanks to my God -- more than you all with tongues speaking --"
but in an assembly I wish to speak five words through my understanding
Brethren
in the law it hath been written
so that the tongues are for a sign
If
and if all may prophecy
and so the secrets of his heart become manifest
What then is it
if an `unknown' tongue any one do speak
and if there may be no interpreter
And prophets -- let two or three speak
and if to another sitting `anything' may be revealed
for ye are able
and the spiritual gift of prophets to prophets are subject
for God is not `a God' of tumult
Your women in the assemblies let them be silent
and if they wish to learn anything
From you did the word of God come forth? or to you alone did it come?"
if any one doth think to be a prophet
and if any one is ignorant -- let him be ignorant;"
so that
let all things be done decently and in order."
