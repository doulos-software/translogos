And I make known to you
through which also ye are being saved
for I delivered to you first
and that he was buried
and that he appeared to Cephas
afterwards he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once
afterwards he appeared to James
And last of all -- as to the untimely birth -- he appeared also to me
for I am the least of the apostles
and by the grace of God I am what I am
whether
And if Christ is preached
and if there be no rising again of dead persons
and if Christ hath not risen

and that which thou dost sow
and God doth give to it a body according as He willed
All flesh `is' not the same flesh
and `there are' heavenly bodies
one glory of sun

it is sown in dishonour
it is sown a natural body
so also it hath been written
but that which is spiritual `is' not first
The first man `is' out of the earth
as `is' the earthy
and
And this I say
lo
in a moment
for it behoveth this corruptible to put on incorruption
and when this corruptible may have put on incorruption
where
and the sting of the death `is' the sin
and to God -- thanks
so that
