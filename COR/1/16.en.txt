And concerning the collection that `is' for the saints
on every first `day' of the week
and whenever I may come
and if it be meet for me also to go
And I will come unto you
and with you
for I do not wish to see you now in the passing
and I will remain in Ephesus till the Pentecost
for a door to me hath been opened -- great and effectual -- and withstanders `are' many."
And if Timotheus may come
no one
and concerning Apollos our brother
Watch ye
let all your things be done in love."
And I entreat you
that ye also be subject to such
and I rejoice over the presence of Stephanas
for they did refresh my spirit and yours; acknowledge ye
Salute you do the assemblies of Asia; salute you much in the Lord do Aquilas and Priscilla
salute you do all the brethren; salute ye one another in an holy kiss."
The salutation of `me' Paul with my hand;"
if any one doth not love the Lord Jesus Christ -- let him be anathema! The Lord hath come!"
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ `is' with you;"
my love `is' with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen."
