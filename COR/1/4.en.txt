Let a man so reckon us as officers of Christ
and as to the rest
and to me it is for a very little thing that by you I may be judged
for of nothing to myself have I been conscious
so
And these things
for who doth make thee to differ? and what hast thou
Already ye are having been filled
for I think that God did set forth us the apostles last -- as appointed to death
we `are' fools because of Christ
unto the present hour we both hunger
and labour
being spoken evil of
Not `as' putting you to shame do I write these things
for if a myriad of child-conductors ye may have in Christ
I call upon you
because of this I sent to you Timotheus
And as if I were not coming unto you certain were puffed up;"
but I will come quickly unto you
for not in word is the reign of God
what do ye wish? with a rod shall I come unto you
