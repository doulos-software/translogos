And I
with milk I fed you
for yet ye are fleshly
for when one may say
Who
I planted
so that neither is he who is planting anything
and he who is planting and he who is watering are one
for of God we are fellow-workmen; God's tillage
According to the grace of God that was given to me
for other foundation no one is able to lay except that which is laid
and if any one doth build upon this foundation gold
of each the work shall become manifest
if of any one the work doth remain that he built on `it'
if of any the work is burned up
have ye not known that ye are a sanctuary of God
if any one the sanctuary of God doth waste
Let no one deceive himself; if any one doth seem to be wise among you in this age -- let him become a fool
for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God
and again
So then
whether Paul
and ye `are' Christ's
