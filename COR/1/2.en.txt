And I
for I decided not to know any thing among you
and I
and my word and my preaching was not in persuasive words of human wisdom
that your faith may not be in the wisdom of men
And wisdom we speak among the perfect
but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a secret
which no one of the rulers of this age did know
but
but to us did God reveal `them' through His Spirit
for who of men hath known the things of the man
And we the spirit of the world did not receive
which things also we speak
and the natural man doth not receive the things of the Spirit of God
and he who is spiritual
for who did know the mind of the Lord that he shall instruct Him? and we -- we have the mind of Christ."
