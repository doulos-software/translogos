If with the tongues of men and of messengers I speak
and if I have prophecy
and if I give away to feed others all my goods
The love is long-suffering
doth not act unseemly
rejoiceth not over the unrighteousness
all things it beareth
The love doth never fail; and whether `there be' prophecies
for in part we know
and when that which is perfect may come
When I was a babe
for we see now through a mirror obscurely
and now there doth remain faith
