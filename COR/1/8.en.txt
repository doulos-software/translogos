And concerning the things sacrificed to idols
and if any one doth think to know anything
and if any one doth love God
Concerning the eating then of the things sacrificed to idols
for even if there are those called gods
yet to us `is' one God
but not in all men `is' the knowledge
But victuals do not commend us to God
but see
for if any one may see thee that hast knowledge in an idol's temple reclining at meat -- shall not his conscience -- he being infirm -- be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to idols
and the brother who is infirm shall perish by thy knowledge
and thus sinning in regard to the brethren
wherefore
