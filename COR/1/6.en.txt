Dare any one of you
have ye not known that the saints shall judge the world? and if by you the world is judged
have ye not known that we shall judge messengers? why not then the things of life?"
of the things of life
unto your shame I speak: so there is not among you one wise man
but brother with brother doth go to be judged
Already
but ye -- ye do injustice
have ye not known that the unrighteous the reign of God shall not inherit? be not led astray; neither whoremongers
nor thieves
And certain of you were these! but ye were washed
All things are lawful to me
the meats `are' for the belly
and God both the Lord did raise
Have ye not known that your bodies are members of Christ? having taken
have ye not known that he who is joined to the harlot is one body? `for they shall be -- saith He -- the two for one flesh.'"
And he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit;"
flee the whoredom; every sin -- whatever a man may commit -- is without the body
Have ye not known that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit in you
for ye were bought with a price; glorify
