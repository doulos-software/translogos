To boast
I have known a man in Christ
and I have known such a man -- whether in the body
that he was caught away to the paradise
Of such an one I will boast
for if I may wish to boast
and that by the exceeding greatness of the revelations I might not be exalted overmuch
Concerning this thing thrice the Lord did I call upon
and He said to me
wherefore I am well pleased in infirmities
I have become a fool -- boasting; ye -- ye did compel me; for I ought by you to have been commended
The signs
for what is there in which ye were inferior to the rest of the assemblies
Lo
and I most gladly will spend and be entirely spent for your souls
And be it `so'
any one of those whom I have sent unto you -- by him did I take advantage of you?"
I entreated Titus
Again
for I fear lest
lest again having come
