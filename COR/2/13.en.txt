This third time do I come unto you; on the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every saying be established;"
I have said before
since a proof ye seek of the Christ speaking in me
for even if he was crucified from infirmity
Your ownselves try ye
and I hope that ye shall know that we -- we are not disapproved of;"
and I pray before God that ye do no evil
for we are not able to do anything against the truth
for we rejoice when we may be infirm
because of this
Henceforth
salute one another in an holy kiss;"
salute you do all the saints;"
the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
