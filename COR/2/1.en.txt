Paul
Grace to you and peace from God our Father
Blessed `is' God
who is comforting us in all our tribulation
because
and whether we be in tribulation
and our hope `is' stedfast for you
For we do not wish you to be ignorant
but we ourselves in ourselves the sentence of the death have had
who out of so great a death did deliver us
ye working together also for us by your supplication
For our glorying is this: the testimony of our conscience
for no other things do we write to you
according as also ye did acknowledge us in part
and in this confidence I was purposing to come unto you before
and through you to pass to Macedonia
This
and God `is' faithful
for the Son of God
for as many as `are' promises of God
and He who is confirming you with us into Christ
who also sealed us
And I for a witness on God do call upon my soul
not that we are lords over your faith
