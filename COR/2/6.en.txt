And working together also we call upon `you' that ye receive not in vain the grace of God --"
for He saith
in nothing giving any cause of offence
but in everything recommending ourselves as God's ministrants; in much patience
in stripes
in pureness
in the word of truth
through glory and dishonour
as unknown
as sorrowful
Our mouth hath been open unto you
ye are not straitened in us
and `as' a recompense of the same kind
Become not yoked with others -- unbelievers
and what fellowship to light with darkness? and what concord to Christ with Belial? or what part to a believer with an unbeliever?"
and what agreement to the sanctuary of God with idols? for ye are a sanctuary of the living God
wherefore
and I will be to you for a Father
