O that ye were bearing with me a little of the folly
for I am zealous for you with zeal of God
and I fear
for if
for I reckon that I have been nothing behind the very chiefest apostles
and even if unlearned in word -- yet not in knowledge
The sin did I do -- myself humbling that ye might be exalted
other assemblies I did rob
and being present with you
The truth of Christ is in me
wherefore? because I do not love you? God hath known!"
and what I do
for those such `are' false apostles
and no wonder -- for even the Adversary doth transform himself into a messenger of light;"
no great thing
Again I say
That which I speak
since many boast according to the flesh
for gladly do ye bear with the fools -- being wise
for ye bear
in reference to dishonour I speak
Hebrews are they? I also! Israelites are they? I also! seed of Abraham are they? I also!"
ministrants of Christ are they? -- as beside myself I speak -- I more; in labours more abundantly
from Jews five times forty `stripes' save one I did receive;"
thrice was I beaten with rods
journeyings many times
in laboriousness and painfulness
apart from the things without -- the crowding upon me that is daily -- the care of all the assemblies."
Who is infirm
if to boast it behoveth `me'
the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ -- who is blessed to the ages -- hath known that I do not lie! --"
