And we make known to you
because in much trial of tribulation the abundance of their joy
because
with much entreaty calling on us to receive the favour and the fellowship of the ministration to the saints
and not according as we expected
so that we exhorted Titus
but even as in every thing ye do abound
not according to command do I speak
for ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
and an opinion in this do I give: for this to you `is' expedient
and now also finish doing `it'
for if the willing mind is present
for not that for others release
but by equality
according as it hath been written
And thanks to God
because indeed the exhortation he accepted
and we sent with him the brother
and not only so
avoiding this
providing right things
and we sent with them our brother
whether -- about Titus -- my partner and towards you fellow-worker
the shewing therefore of your love
