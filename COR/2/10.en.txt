And I
and I beseech `you'
for walking in the flesh
for the weapons of our warfare `are' not fleshly
reasonings bringing down
and being in readiness to avenge every disobedience
The things in presence do ye see? if any one hath trusted in himself to be Christ's
for even if also anything more abundantly I shall boast concerning our authority
that I may not seem as if I would terrify you through the letters
`because the letters indeed -- saith one -- `are' weighty and strong
This one -- let him reckon thus: that such as we are in word
For we do not make bold to rank or to compare ourselves with certain of those commending themselves
and we in regard to the unmeasured things will not boast ourselves
for not as not reaching to you do we stretch ourselves overmuch
not boasting of the things not measured
in the `places' beyond you to proclaim good news
and he who is boasting -- in the Lord let him boast;"
for not he who is commending himself is approved
