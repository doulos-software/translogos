For
for I have known your readiness of mind
and I sent the brethren
lest if Macedonians may come with me
Necessary
And this: He who is sowing sparingly
each one
and God `is' able all grace to cause to abound to you
(according as it hath been written
and may He who is supplying seed to the sower
in every thing being enriched to all liberality
because the ministration of this service not only is supplying the wants of the saints
through the proof of this ministration glorifying God for the subjection of your confession to the good news of the Christ
and by their supplication in your behalf
thanks also to God for His unspeakable gift!"
