And I decided this to myself
for if I make you sorry
and I wrote to you this same thing
for out of much tribulation and pressure of heart I wrote to you through many tears
And if any one hath caused sorrow
sufficient to such a one is this punishment
so that
wherefore
for
And to whom ye forgive anything -- I also; for I also
that we may not be over-reached by the Adversary
And having come to Troas for the good news of the Christ
I have not had rest to my spirit
and to God `are' thanks
because of Christ a sweet fragrance we are to God
to the one
for we are not as the many
