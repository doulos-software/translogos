For we have known that if our earthly house of the tabernacle may be thrown down
for also in this we groan
if so be that
for we also who are in the tabernacle do groan
And He who did work us to this self-same thing `is' God
having courage
for through faith we walk
we have courage
Wherefore also we are ambitious
for all of us it behoveth to be manifested before the tribunal of the Christ
having known
for not again ourselves do we recommend to you
for whether we were beside ourselves
for the love of the Christ doth constrain us
and for all he died
So that we henceforth have known no one according to the flesh
so that if any one `is' in Christ -- `he is' a new creature; the old things did pass away
And the all things `are' of God
how that God was in Christ -- a world reconciling to Himself
in behalf of Christ
for him who did not know sin
