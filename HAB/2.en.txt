On my charge I stand
And Jehovah answereth me and saith: `Write a vision
For yet the vision `is' for a season
Lo
And also
Do not these -- all of them -- against him a simile taken up
Do not thy usurers instantly rise up
Because thou hast spoiled many nations
Wo `to' him who is gaining evil gain for his house
Thou hast counselled a shameful thing to thy house
For a stone from the wall doth cry out
Wo `to' him who is building a city by blood
Lo
For full is the earth of the knowledge of the honour of Jehovah
Wo `to' him who is giving drink to his neighbour
Thou hast been filled -- shame without honour
For violence `to' Lebanon doth cover thee
What profit hath a graven image given That its former hath graven it? A molten image and teacher of falsehood
Wo `to' him who is saying to wood
And Jehovah `is' in His holy temple
