A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet concerning erring ones:"
O Jehovah
God from Teman doth come
And the brightness is as the light
Before Him goeth pestilence
He hath stood
Under sorrow I have seen tents of Cushan
Against rivers hath Jehovah been wroth? Against rivers `is' Thine anger? Against the sea `is' Thy wrath? For Thou dost ride on Thy horses -- Thy chariots of salvation?"
Utterly naked Thou dost make Thy bow
Seen thee -- pained are mountains
Sun -- moon -- hath stood -- a habitation
In indignation Thou dost tread earth
Thou hast gone forth for the salvation of Thy people
Thou hast pierced with his staves the head of his leaders
Thou hast proceeded through the sea with Thy horses -- the clay of many waters."
I have heard
Though the fig-tree doth not flourish
Yet I
Jehovah the Lord `is' my strength
