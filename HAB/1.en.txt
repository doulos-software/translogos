The burden that Habakkuk the prophet hath seen:"
Till when
Why dost Thou shew me iniquity
Therefore doth law cease
Look ye on nations
For
Terrible and fearful it `is'
Swifter than leopards have been its horses
Wholly for violence it doth come in
And at kings it doth scoff
Then passed on hath the spirit
Art not Thou of old
Purer of eyes than to behold evil
And Thou makest man as fishes of the sea
Each of them with a hook he hath brought up
Therefore he doth sacrifice to his net
Doth he therefore empty his net
