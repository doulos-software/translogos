And I saw another sign in the heaven
and I saw as a sea of glass mingled with fire
and they sing the song of Moses
who may not fear Thee
And after these things I saw
and come forth did the seven messengers having the seven plagues
and one of the four living creatures did give to the seven messengers seven golden vials
and filled was the sanctuary with smoke from the glory of God
