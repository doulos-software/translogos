And to the messenger of the assembly in Sardis write: These things saith he who is having the Seven Spirits of God
become watching
`Remember
Thou hast a few names even in Sardis who did not defile their garments
He who is overcoming -- this one -- shall be arrayed in white garments
He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies."
`And to the messenger of the assembly in Philadelphia write: These things saith he who is holy
I have known thy works; lo
lo
`Because thou didst keep the word of my endurance
Lo
He who is overcoming -- I will make him a pillar in the sanctuary of my God
He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies."
`And to the messenger of the assembly of the Laodiceans write: These things saith the Amen
I have known thy works
So -- because thou art lukewarm
because thou sayest -- I am rich
I counsel thee to buy from me gold fired by fire
`As many as I love
lo
He who is overcoming -- I will give to him to sit with me in my throne
He who is having an ear -- let him hear what the Spirit saith to the assemblies.'"
