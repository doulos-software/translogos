And I saw
and I heard a voice out of the heaven
and they sing
these are they who with women were not defiled
and in their mouth there was not found guile
And I saw another messenger flying in mid-heaven
saying in a great voice
And another messenger did follow
And a third messenger did follow them
he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God
and the smoke of their torment doth go up to ages of ages; and they have no rest day and night
Here is endurance of the saints: here `are' those keeping the commands of God
And I heard a voice out of the heaven saying to me
And I saw
and another messenger did come forth out of the sanctuary crying in a great voice to him who is sitting upon the cloud
and he who is sitting upon the cloud did put forth his sickle upon the earth
And another messenger did come forth out of the sanctuary that `is' in the heaven
and another messenger did come forth out from the altar
and the messenger did put forth his sickle to the earth
and trodden was the wine-press outside of the city
