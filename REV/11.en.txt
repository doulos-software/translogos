And there was given to me a reed like to a rod
and the court that is without the sanctuary leave out
and I will give to My two witnesses
these are the two olive `trees'
and if any one may will to injure them
These have authority to shut the heaven
`And when they may finish their testimony
and their dead bodies `are' upon the broad-place of the great city (that is called spiritually Sodom
and they shall behold -- they of the peoples
and those dwelling upon the land shall rejoice over them
And after the three days and a half
and they heard a great voice out of the heaven saying to them
and in that hour came a great earthquake
The second wo did go forth
And the seventh messenger did sound
and the twenty and four elders
saying
and the nations were angry
And opened was the sanctuary of God in the heaven
