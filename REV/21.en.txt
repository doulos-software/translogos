And I saw a new heaven and a new earth
and I
and I heard a great voice out of the heaven
and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes
And He who is sitting upon the throne said
and He said to me
he who is overcoming shall inherit all things
and to fearful
And there came unto me one of the seven messengers
and he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high
having the glory of God
having also a wall great and high
at the east three gates
and the wall of the city had twelve foundations
And he who is speaking with me had a golden reed
and the city lieth square
and he measured its wall
and the building of its wall was jasper
and the foundations of the wall of the city with every precious stone have been adorned; the first foundation jasper; the second
the fifth
And the twelve gates `are' twelve pearls
And a sanctuary I did not see in it
and the city hath no need of the sun
and the nations of the saved in its light shall walk
and its gates shall not at all be shut by day
and they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations into it;"
and there may not at all enter into it any thing defiling and doing abomination
