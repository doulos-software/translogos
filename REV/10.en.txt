And I saw another strong messenger coming down out of the heaven
and he had in his hand a little scroll opened
and he cried with a great voice
and when the seven thunders spake their voices
And the messenger whom I saw standing upon the sea
and did swear in Him who doth live to the ages of the ages
but in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger
And the voice that I heard out of the heaven is again speaking with me
and I went away unto the messenger
And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the messenger
and he saith to me
