A revelation of Jesus Christ
who did testify the word of God
Happy is he who is reading
John to the seven assemblies that `are' in Asia: Grace to you
and from Jesus Christ
and did make us kings and priests to his God and Father
Lo
`I am the Alpha and the Omega
I
I was in the Spirit on the Lord's-day
`I am the Alpha and the Omega
And I did turn to see the voice that did speak with me
and in the midst of the seven lamp-stands
and his head and hairs white
and his feet like to fine brass
and having in his right hand seven stars
And when I saw him
and he who is living
`Write the things that thou hast seen
the secret of the seven stars that thou hast seen upon my right hand
