And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals
and I saw
And when he opened the second seal
and there went forth another horse -- red
And when he opened the third seal
and I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying
And when he opened the fourth seal
and I saw
And when he opened the fifth seal
and they were crying with a great voice
and there was given to each one white robes
And I saw when he opened the sixth seal
and the stars of the heaven fell to the earth -- as a fig-tree doth cast her winter figs
and heaven departed as a scroll rolled up
and the kings of the earth
and they say to the mountains and to the rocks
because come did the great day of His anger
