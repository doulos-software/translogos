And I heard a great voice out of the sanctuary saying to the seven messengers
and the first did go away
And the second messenger did pour out his vial to the sea
And the third messenger did pour out his vial to the rivers
and I heard the messenger of the waters
because blood of saints and prophets they did pour out
and I heard another out of the altar
And the fourth messenger did pour out his vial upon the sun
and men were scorched with great heat
And the fifth messenger did pour out his vial upon the throne of the beast
and they did speak evil of the God of the heaven
And the sixth messenger did pour out his vial upon the great river
and I saw `come' out of the mouth of the dragon
for they are spirits of demons
`lo
and they did bring them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Armageddon."
And the seventh messenger did pour out his vial to the air
and there came voices
And it came -- the great city -- into three parts
and every island did flee away
and great hail (as of talent weight) doth come down out of the heaven upon men
