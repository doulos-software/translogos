And after these things I saw another messenger coming down out of the heaven
and he did cry in might -- a great voice
because of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom have all the nations drunk
And I heard another voice out of the heaven
because her sins did follow -- unto the heaven
Render to her as also she did render to you
`As much as she did glorify herself and did revel
because of this
and weep over her
from afar having stood because of the fear of her torment
`And the merchants of the earth shall weep and sorrow over her
lading of gold
and cinnamon
`And the fruits of the desire of thy soul did go away from thee
The merchants of these things
and saying
`And every shipmaster
and were crying
and they did cast dust upon their heads
`Be glad over her
And one strong messenger did take up a stone as a great millstone
and voice of harpers
and light of a lamp may not shine at all in thee any more; and voice of bridegroom and of bride may not be heard at all in thee any more; because thy merchants were the great ones of the earth
and in her blood of prophets and of saints was found
