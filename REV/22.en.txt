And he shewed me a pure river of water of life
in the midst of its broad place
and any curse there shall not be any more
and they shall see His face
and night shall not be there
And he said to me
Lo
And I
and he saith to me
And he saith to me
he who is unrighteous -- let him be unrighteous still
And lo
I am the Alpha and the Omega -- the Beginning and End -- the First and the Last."
`Happy are those doing His commands that the authority shall be theirs unto the tree of the life
and without `are' the dogs
`I
And the Spirit and the Bride say
`For I testify to every one hearing the words of the prophecy of this scroll
and if any one may take away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy
he saith -- who is testifying these things -- `Yes
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ `is' with you all. Amen."
