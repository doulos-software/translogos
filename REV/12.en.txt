And a great sign was seen in the heaven
and being with child she doth cry out
And there was seen another sign in the heaven
and his tail doth draw the third of the stars of the heaven
and she brought forth a male child
and the woman did flee to the wilderness
And there came war in the heaven; Michael and his messengers did war against the dragon
and they did not prevail
and the great dragon was cast forth -- the old serpent
And I heard a great voice saying in the heaven
and they did overcome him because of the blood of the Lamb
because of this be glad
And when the dragon saw that he was cast forth to the earth
and there were given to the woman two wings of the great eagle
and the serpent did cast forth after the woman
and the land did help the woman
and the dragon was angry against the woman
