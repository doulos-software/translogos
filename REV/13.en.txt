And I stood upon the sand of the sea
and the beast that I saw was like to a leopard
And I saw one of its heads as slain to death
and they did bow before the dragon who did give authority to the beast
And there was given to it a mouth speaking great things
and it did open its mouth for evil-speaking toward God
and there was given to it to make war with the saints
And bow before it shall all who are dwelling upon the land
if any one hath an ear -- let him hear:"
if any one a captivity doth gather
And I saw another beast coming up out of the land
and all the authority of the first beast doth it do before it
and it doth great signs
and it leadeth astray those dwelling on the land
and there was given to it to give a spirit to the image of the beast
And it maketh all
and that no one may be able to buy
Here is the wisdom! He who is having the understanding
