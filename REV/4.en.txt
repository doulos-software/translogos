After these things I saw
and immediately I was in the Spirit
and He who is sitting was in sight like a stone
And around the throne `are' thrones twenty and four
and out of the throne proceed do lightnings
and before the throne `is' a sea of glass like to crystal
and the first living creature `is' like a lion
And the four living creatures
and when the living creatures do give glory
fall down do the twenty and four elders before Him who is sitting upon the throne
`Worthy art Thou
