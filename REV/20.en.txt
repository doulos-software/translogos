And I saw a messenger coming down out of the heaven
and he laid hold on the dragon
and he cast him to the abyss
And I saw thrones
and the rest of the dead did not live again till the thousand years may be finished; this `is' the first rising again."
Happy and holy `is' he who is having part in the first rising again; over these the second death hath not authority
And when the thousand years may be finished
and he shall go forth to lead the nations astray
and they did go up over the breadth of the land
and the Devil
And I saw a great white throne
and I saw the dead
and the sea did give up those dead in it
and the death and the hades were cast to the lake of the fire -- this `is' the second death;"
and if any one was not found written in the scroll of the life
