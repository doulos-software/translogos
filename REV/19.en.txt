And after these things I heard a great voice of a great multitude in the heaven
because true and righteous `are' His judgments
and a second time they said
And fall down did the elders -- the twenty and four -- and the four living creatures
And a voice out of the throne did come forth
and I heard as the voice of a great multitude
may we rejoice and exult
and there was given to her that she may be arrayed with fine linen
And he saith to me
and I fell before his feet
And I saw the heaven having been opened
and his eyes `are' as a flame of fire
and he is arrayed with a garment covered with blood
And the armies in the heaven were following him upon white horses
and out of his mouth doth proceed a sharp sword
and he hath upon the garment and upon his thigh the name written
And I saw one messenger standing in the sun
that ye may eat flesh of kings
And I saw the beast
and the beast was taken
and the rest were killed with the sword of him who is sitting on the horse
