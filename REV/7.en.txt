And after these things I saw four messengers
and I saw another messenger going up from the rising of the sun
`Do not injure the land
And I heard the number of those sealed
of the tribe of Judah 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Reuben 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Gad 12 thousand were sealed;"
of the tribe of Asher 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Naphtali 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Manasseh 12 thousand were sealed;"
of the tribe of Simeon 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Levi 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Issachar 12 thousand were sealed;"
of the tribe of Zebulun 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Joseph 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Benjamin 12 thousand were sealed."
After these things I saw
and crying with a great voice
And all the messengers stood around the throne
saying
And answer did one of the elders
and I have said to him
because of this are they before the throne of God
they shall not hunger any more
because the Lamb that `is' in the midst of the throne shall feed them
