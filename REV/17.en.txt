And there came one of the seven messengers
with whom the kings of the earth did commit whoredom; and made drunk from the wine of her whoredom were those inhabiting the earth;'"
and he carried me away to a wilderness in the Spirit
and the woman was arrayed with purple and scarlet-colour
and upon her forehead was a name written: `Secret
And I saw the woman drunken from the blood of the saints
and the messenger said to me
`The beast that thou didst see: it was
`Here `is' the mind that is having wisdom; the seven heads are seven mountains
and there are seven kings
and the beast that was
`And the ten horns that thou sawest
these have one mind
these with the Lamb shall make war
And he saith to me
and the ten horns that thou didst see upon the beast
for God did give into their hearts to do its mind
and the woman that thou didst see is the great city that is having reign over the kings of the land.'"
