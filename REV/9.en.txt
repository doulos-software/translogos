And the fifth messenger did sound
and he did open the pit of the abyss
And out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth
and it was said to them that they may not injure the grass of the earth
and it was given to them that they may not kill them
and in those days shall men seek the death
And the likenesses of the locusts `are' like to horses made ready to battle
and they had hair as hair of women
and they had breastplates as breastplates of iron
and they have tails like to scorpions
and they have over them a king -- the messenger of the abyss -- a name `is' to him in Hebrew
The first wo did go forth
And the sixth messenger did sound
saying to the sixth messenger who had the trumpet
and loosed were the four messengers
and the number of the forces of the horsemen `is' two myriads of myriads
And thus I saw the horses in the vision
by these three were the third of men killed
for their authorities are in their mouth
and the rest of men
yea they did not reform from their murders
